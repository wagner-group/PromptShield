        "instruction": "Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material\n\nQuestion/Instruction: What is the author's opinion on the Demarcus Ware signing and how it may impact the team?\n\nGiven material: Until the Ware deal, I would have said that this was all according to the standard pattern, part of which is to make big deals with young free agents and smaller, shorter deals with older free agents. The TJ Ward signing simply indicates that their forecast of Ihenacho is not quite what I hoped it would be. They had to sign a CB, and overpaying DRC was never a good option.\nManning was, of course, an exception but I think the QB roster needs to be thought of as an exceptional project on a number of levels. Nothing in teams sports quite compares.\nI'm a little sticker-shocked by the Demarcus Ware price tag that has been quoted: 3 years, $30 million, $20 million guaranteed. I'm hoping the specifics of the contract somehow look better than what this seems like: a big risk on a player whose productivity is declining with age.\nI'm going backwards on these, but this is where I was headed. If that $22 million is correct on Talib, that's $42 million guaranteed for 2 players, both of whom have risk factors. A lot of this is minimizing risk as much as getting bang for buck. That's the other issue that makes Ward so appealing - no known risk.\nOn Ware, I don't know what to think. Guys like Abraham and Mathis have proven you can actually get better in the right schemes as you age. But it really bugs me the beating Ware took in that 4-3.\nIt may blow up in their face with Talib and Ware.\nBut they're biting the bullet. They've targeted their weaknesses, and went after the players they think can make the difference.\nPersonally I like that attitude a lot.\nUh ... I'll let the rest of you discuss MLB for a while. It does seem as if it's a remaining sore spot.\nIt'll give everyone something to talk about around here.\nActually, as much as I've been whining about parts of this, you may have a half way decent point here. High praise, indeed!\nBut it really is all part of the package you get with him. If he feels like going for it this season, he's going to go Maverick. Iceman can kiss his big white backside!\nBroncfanOR wrote: Moreno is currently an unsigned free agent and given that other backs have been signed it's still possible Denver signs him.\nI still say I think this is what happens. All the usual suspects (national media) yapping about him out there weren't paying attention to market forces. Nobody is going to pay big bucks to a platoon guy who clearly flourishes with PFM, but has proven nothing beyond that.\nPoor Decker. He's visiting the Jets today. Nothing like going from Manning to Geno Smith. I'm a little surprised there's not more chatter surrounding him.\nIndianGirl wrote: Poor Decker. He's visiting the Jets today.

Is a healthy bird, roasted to perfection, worth a couple of whacks on the nose with a rolled up newspaper?\"\nDRC is a darn good cover guy, but does not like to tackle. Talib is bigger and can/will do both.\nIs Phillips going to the HOF? Ware is. I think Ware is HUGE upgrade, but only time will tell. Phillips is smaller than Ware and is more of an OLB in a 3-4 than a DE.\nBroncorusader last post 10/30 fan since 1976 and not happy we are winning?BroncoVino last post 12/8? He is a fan of the Broncos?\nWinorgetout last post 11/23? Fan since 1974?\nJD Walton is back too.\nHow quickly people forget, as you say, the highest risk/reward free agent signing perhaps EVER ... Peyton Manning.\n[i][b]Denver Broncos general manager John Elway watched as his receivers were physically manhandled by the Seahawks in Super Bowl XLVIII, most notably safety Kam Chancellor.\nOn Day 1 of free agency, Elway got his own version of Chancellor by signing Browns safety T.J. Ward, as he announced on his Twitter page. Mike Klis of The Denver Post reports that the deal is for four years and $23 million, with $14 million guaranteed.\nWard finished 2013 ranked as Pro Football Focus' (subscription required) third-best safety and is a physical and disruptive presence in the secondary. He will bring a toughness that the Broncos defense desperately needs.\nLater in the night, Elway added Patriots cornerback Aqib Talib, inking him to a six-year, $57 million deal with $26 million guaranteed, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.\nAnd in addition to signing Ward and Talib, Schefter is reporting that the Broncos have emerged as the front-runners to sign former Cowboys pass-rusher DeMarcus Ware.\nApparently...more than so called \"kool aid drinkers\" think Elway is getting it done.\nAdam Shefter? wasn't he a former broncos beat writer?\nWe don't care about Allen, Peppers and Freeney \"over the same time frame.\" We just care about what he does in 2014. He does have HOF numbers and he is a quality person (like Peppers and Freeney).\nI do worship at the altar of St. John (I just bowed my head when I typed that). St. John must of have wanted him a whole lot cause it seemed like he was signed within an hour of the jet landing.\nWhen you think about some of the pass rushers we skipped over last year like Freeney and then landed Phillips, I am going to keep bowing my head.\nWare and Allen have not been to the Super Bowl. Peppers got to the Super Bowl playing on a John Fox team. They are all on the bubble.\nFreeney might make the HOF because he was on a Super Bowl winning team lead by Peyton Manning.\nPhillips - NO CHANCE !!!!!\nAre you still kneeling in front of your Tebow poster??\nravenpic wrote: Demarcus Ware is intriguing. if you can land him and Arthur Jones. It's interesting .... I have my pick at LB opposite Miller. Miller must have a comeback year.\nArthur Joens already signed with the Colts.\nThe Colts had the best chance of getting him...and they did.\nHe hasn't been worse either. My point is he is an upgrade over Phillips. I think if Ware helps the Broncos win a Super Bowl (or two) he will end up in the HOF. No matter what Phillips does, he won't.\nIt's a sad day indeed when we have a Ravens fan in here being more positive than some \"Bronco\" fans. Really says more about the person than the team.",

The booklet, PSFK Snapshot, purported to be a sort of guidebook to San Francisco\u2019s most cutting-edge culture, the places to find the real trend-setters, or \u201cinfluencers,\u201d which I think is the more current term.\nCurious, I ordered the book (seen at left). It\u2019s a square booklet about 4 inches on a side, and about 56 pages long. It lists a few cafes, restaurants, art galleries, community events and so on. The list is pretty standard hipster fare: Blue Bottle Coffee, Red Poppy Art House, The Crucible, Maker Faire, Burning Man. In other words, nothing you wouldn\u2019t learn living in San Francisco for one week, or by reading this blog, SFist, and BoingBoing for a month or so.\nI got through the whole book in about 90 seconds, and when I was done I understood even less what the book was for. Suppose it is absolutely essential to know that the most snobbish coffee fanatics go to Blue Bottle. If I\u2019m in the advertising industry, what is that knowledge going to get me?\nIn fact, I was much more interested in the booklet as a product of the Blurb publishing website, where you can upload photos and text and have them print a pretty little book. If I were a photographer, or preparing a booklet for my mother\u2019s 70th birthday or something, it looks like a great service.\nWhat does the author find more interesting about the PSFK Snapshot booklet, and why?",

        "instruction": "What are some other examples of cruise ships that were transformed beyond recognition, and how did these vessels change in terms of appearance, features, and operator?\nGenerate according to: has witnessed other equally exciting processes, when already popular vessels were changed considerably.\nFor example, there were cases when well-known cruise liners were cut in half to get additional sections (you can find several videos of the cruise ship extension via this link).\nThis time we\u2019d like to share a list of liners that were transformed beyond recognition. Let\u2019s take a short trip through the history of cruise ships.\nWe are sure many of you have heard about Carnival Cruise Line\u2019s Jubilee, and not just heard but also sailed on her.\nThe world greeted this legendary liner in 1986. She served Carnival until 2004 when she joined P&O Cruises Australia\u2019s fleet as Pacific Sun.\nWhat\u2019s the first thing you\u2019ve noticed about the refurbished vessel? That\u2019s right! The well-known Carnival\u2019s funnel was removed.\nWe should note that funnels of her near-sister ships, Celebration and Holiday, were simply painted after the vessels had left Carnival. Each of them is still in service.\nJubilee was scrapped as the Hen last year.\nBy the way, Jubilee was not the only ship that said goodbye to her distinctive funnel when she joined another family.\nTropicale (1981) was the Carnival's 1st custom designed liner - she received its distinctive \u201cwhale tale.\u201d When she became Costa Tropicale, the Carnival\u2019s \u201cwhale tail\" was replaced with Costa Cruises's round stove-pipe funnel.\nYes, this cruise ship had the famous \"whale tale\" when she was constructed. In this video, she looks like the full-fledged representative of Costa fleet.\nMV Nordic Prince joined Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines' family in 1971. Her 1st significant transformation was held nine years later when she became 26 meters longer. In 1995, she began to operate sailing as Carousel for Sun Cruises after her distinctive feature, sky lounge around the liner\u2019s funnel, was withdrawn.\nAfter changing different names and operators, our heroine was decommissioned in 2015.\nNordic Prince had the same lounge.\nMV Kungsholm started her career as the ocean liner/cruise ship in 1965. In 1978, she joined P&O, which rebuilt the ship, and changes appeared to be really considerable.\nShe was left without the forward funnel, and the remaining one was reshaped. The vessel got additional cabins, which increased her tonnage from 26,678 to 27,670 and capacity from 450 guests (as the cruise ship) to 750 travelers. She became known as Sea Princess.\nThe liner had an eventful history. Several times, she changed companies, names, and functions (she served as a floating accommodation, educational vessel, etc.), and her livery was also changed several times. Probably, the way she looked as Mona Lisa was the most impressive.\nThis video shows the story of her incredible changes.\nUnfortunately, Kungsholm went for demolition in 2016.\nMS Finnhansa started her career in 1966 as the ferry. Besides, she offered weekend cruises in summer 1967. In 1972, she received nearly 300 new staterooms. Another transformation took place in 1973.\nThe most extensive refurbishment was carried out in 1980. At that time, the ship was already known as MS Prinsessan (Birka Line). The liner got a new shape, additional staterooms (on the car deck) and public venues.\nWhen she joined Louis Cruise Lines as Princesa Marissa, she was transformed again.\nYes, you can still find some distinctive features of MS Finnhansa in the second picture. Nevertheless, the transformation is impressive.\nShe was scrapped in 2008.\nOur next heroine took her maiden voyage back in 1948 as the ocean liner called Stockholm. She had a hard fate: the ship collided with another ocean liner, was nicknamed the \u201cship of death,\u201d attacked by pirates, and detained for unpaid fuel bills. However, it\u2019s not the subject of our article.\nAfter the infamous collision with SS Andrea Doria, the ship changed not only operators and names but also her appearance. Ex-Stockholm was given a modern cruise ship design in the 2000\u2019s.\nMS Sally Albatross (currently known as Celestyal Crystal) was a cruise ferry called MS Viking Saga. She took her maiden voyage in 1980. Six years later, she was reconstructed and entered service as the cruise ship. However, Sally Albatross could be hardly called the full-fledged cruise ship since her car decks were not built in.\nIn 1988, Sally Albatross underwent another extensive renovation. She got additional staterooms instead of the car deck, the forward superstructure, and other changes.\nNext reconstruction that took place in 1990 was fatal. Her hull burnt out after a three-day fire. Nevertheless, in 1992, new Sally Albatross with the extended hull and increased capacity began to offer sailing again. She was transformed beyond recognition, and many cruise lovers even considered her as the new liner.\nOur next ship started her story in 1969 as a container ship Axel Johnson. The initial attempt to convert her into the cruise ship was made in 1986 when she became a member of Regency Cruises. However, it had failed, and the vessel remained laid up until she joined Costa Cruises in 1988. She became the cruise ship and got the new name of Costa Marina.\nThen the vessel operated sailings for several lines. In 2014, the liner was sent for demolition.\nWe should note that Costa Marina was not the only one ship that underwent such impressive changes. Costa Allegra also was built as the container ship (in 1969). Originally, she sailed as Annie Johnson. Just like our previous heroine, the ship was transformed beyond recognition when she joined Costa in 1992.\nUnfortunately, the liner went to ship breaking yard in 2012.\nThe change is dramatic. Can you believe that well-known Costa Marina and Costa Allegra looked like this?\nDifferent cruise liners, fascinating stories, incredible transformations \u2013 each of them left a trace in the fantastic cruise ships history that keeps surprising us with new exciting facts.\nDo you know other cruise ships that were transformed considerably?

        "instruction": "Given the text: Here's a sneak preview of the chocolate chip version of today's recipe.\nWhen we were in Lisbon this winter on vacation, we were thrilled with everything. Here's the quaint view view from our window on the third floor.\nI\u2019m including some pictures so you\u2019ll get an idea of the exercise you get walking up stairs and hills in Lisbon and also how important food seems to be. Restaurants everywhere! And many of them put out tables and tablecloths in the narrow older streets of the area where we were staying.\nSee the tables and umbrellas? You could be brushed by the wing mirrors!\nEverything felt festive in the night sitting outdoors.\nAs it was March, they put out blankets too, in case you felt chilled. We really enjoyed our meals on this trip. We didn\u2019t gain an ounce because we did so much walking including these stairs in an ancient castle.\nAnd these on our way to our breakfast every morning.\nSo I guess it\u2019s all right that I had cake for breakfast! Which brings me to today's topic.\nOne of the treats served by our Airbnb host Luis with breakfast (along with bacon, eggs, juice, yogurt, ham, cheese and fruit) was a delicious, light yogurt cake.\nIt is lighter than a pound cake and reminded me a bit of our Zia Lina\u2019s sponge cake, but with many fewer eggs and much less work.\nCake at our breakfast table!\nWe did our best to wheedle the family recipe from our charming host, seen here with his terrific \u2018team\u2019 member, Ana, but failed.\nLuis and Ana kept the conversations going!\nWe did get interesting information about mixing in jam, chocolate, berries or fruit on the top before baking is complete.\nInstead of breakfast you may prefer to serve it as dessert with whipping cream, ice cream and fruit or plain with tea as an afternoon treat. That\u2019s my choice!\nBy the way, it freezes well and is very nice sliced and warmed, by itself or with whipped cream, custard or ice cream.\n\u00be cup unflavored whole milk Greek yogurt, don\u2019t use low fat.\nOptional: \u00bd cup of chopped chocolate or chocolate chips, or sliced fruit or jam added ten to fifteen minutes into baking.\nGrease and flour a tube pan. Be generous, you don\u2019t want the cake to stick.\nIn a stand mixer, cream yogurt and butter until smooth.\nAdd eggs one by one, beating well.\nAdd sugar, slowly, mixing well after every addition.\nCombine flour and baking powder and mix well.\nAdd flour/baking powder to bowl and mix until blended.\nPour into your generously greased tube pan.\nBake 45 minutes at 375 degrees or until a tester comes out clean. Sometimes it just takes longer. Who knows why?\nIf you are adding the chocolate chips, remove cake after ten minutes, dot top with chips or chopped chocolate and stir into cake, about 1/3 down into batter.\nWhen cake is cooked, cool and then, loosen sides of cake and invert pan onto a plate until cake can be removed. Place another plate on the bottom and flip over. Presto!\nWe tested this cake three times and it popped out beautifully each time.\nWhen cool, use a small sieve to dust a tablespoon of icing sugar over the top. This is the plain version with almond flavoring.\nAnd this is a slice of the chocolate chip version shown at the top of the post.\nAs I mentioned, the cake freezes very well and you can cut off a few slices and just warm then in the microwave for ten seconds or so if you have a sudden craving.\nEnjoy this little taste of Portugal!\nWe like to think our book collector mysteries are fun, easy to read and surprising too! All five titles are available in print, e-book and audio format. Don't miss out!\nCan you summarize the recipe for the Yogurt Cake mentioned in the text material?",

        "instruction": "How has PRIME been recently modified to test its experimental components in freefloating conditions? What are the benefits of conducting such tests? Answer according to: PRIME\u2019s main focus has centered on low-velocity collisions in microgravity and has enabled the quantitative analysis of the ejecta mass and velocity produced due to these low-energy impacts. PRIME has previously flown on NASA\u2019s KC-135 Weightles Wonder V (July 2002, August 2002, January, 2003, April 2003, and May 2003) and on Zero-G flights 210, 212, and 293. This experiment has been subjected to lunar, Martian, and 0-g conditions.\nThe experiment was initially designed to experience zero-gravity conditions while fixed to the aircraft. It consisted of 8 independent impact chambers that were stowed when not in use in a rack mounted to the airplane floor. A separate experiment rack, also mounted to the airplane floor, housed one impact chamber, the video head of a high speed NAC HSV 500 camera, and two strobe lights to illuminate the impact chamber. The camera and light controls are mounted on a third rack. After an impact experiment was completed, the next parabola of the airplane was used to swap the old impact chamber into the stowage rack for a new impact chamber.\nRecently, PRIME has been modified to test the experimental components in freefloating conditions to obtain a lower acceleration environment than can be achieved when attached to the airplane floor. All 8 independent impact chambers are mounted separately in an experimental storage unit (ESU) which is attached directly to the aircraft floor.\nEach impact chamber is fixed to the ESU via a steel locking pin which allows for the experiments to operate in two modes: fixed or free-float. While in free-float mode the impact chambers are firmly tethered to the ESU. The results of this technology test will lead to advances in our understanding of the phenomena of dust dynamics near the surfaces of asteroids and moons with low surface gravity. These objects are the targets of planned NASA missions, including OSIRIS-Rex and potential future human exploration missions. It is critical for the development of experiments, hardware, and procedures to understand the behavior of regolith in response to disturbances produced in normal exploration activities. Dust can lead to contamination of optical sensors, jamming of equipment, shorting of electrical circuits, contamination of solar power cells, as well as pose a health hazard to astronauts through inhalation if transported into living quarters. In a low-gravity vacuum environment, the behavior of regolith is qualitatively and quantitatively different than in terrestrial environments. The results of our experiment are directly relevant and beneficial to design and planning of future missions by improving our understanding of the basic physics of such planetary regolith.\nBelow is a video of a Prime impact into JSC1 Lunar Simulant.\nBelow is a video of a Prime impact into Sand.",

        "instruction": "It\u2019s coming home, I can feel it. Football fans across the nation woke up on Tuesday morning with that winning feeling after some late drama in England\u2019s FIFA World CupTM opener last night. Is it time to get excited yet? Probably not but the Three Lions are off to the strong start we\u2019d all hoped for. England have not won an opening game in five consecutive major tournaments and have only made a winning start to a FIFA World CupTM twice, but in Volgograd it was a job well done.\nGareth Southgate\u2019s young side will have impressed more than a few with their approach to their FIFA World CupTM opener and began the game without the crippling fear of failure which seemed to have become a mainstay for the national side. The Three Lions played some fantastic free-flowing football and created chances for fun in the first-half \u2013 the best of them falling to Raheem Sterling and Jesse Lingard. In an exciting opening ten minutes, England hit Tunisia with wave after wave of attacks in what was arguably the most dynamic start to a tournament in recent memory.\nHarry Kane\u2019s close-range opener was deserved and, most impressively, the reaction from the England players was to continue to press and hunt in packs as Tunisia tried to get a foot back in the game. Directly from the restart, England shut down the Tunisian defence at pace and looked certain to kick on and take the game to the North Africans. The creativity of Raheem Sterling, Jesse Lingard and Dele Alli behind Kane was promising to see in the early stages and there were some outstanding passages of play before and after the opening goal.\nBut, after several glorious chances for a second went begging, the game looked to be heading down an all too familiar route. Tunisia\u2019s somewhat undeserved penalty pulled them level and, as the game wore on, looked to have robbed Southgate\u2019s side of a deserved victory. Fans across the country began to rue our missed chances and it looked likely Kane\u2019s men would be punished for not being clinical enough. Tunisia grew into the game throughout the second half and England looked jaded until around the 80th minute when the tempo picked up once again.\nWith the game locked at 1-1 and England desperately in need of that extra bit of quality to make the difference, the stage was set for England\u2019s talisman to show once again why he is our best hope this summer. The youngest captain at the tournament lead by example and as Tottenham fans know, Harry Kane only needs half a chance to turn a game on its head. There was still an awful lot to do when the ball came to Kane on the edge of the six-yard box but he expertly despatched the opportunity. His stooped header generated enough power to guide the ball past the Tunisian shot-stopper.\nSouthgate too should take the plaudits. The manager has stuck by his system of three central defenders with two wing-backs able to bomb forward. Kieran Trippier and Ashley Young offered width throughout the game last night and their defensive knowhow will come in handy when England face tougher opposition. The Three Lions boss also refused to be rushed into making changes. The late introduction of Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Marcus Rashford injected some much-needed drive into the forward line at a time when the game had started to drift away from England \u2013 the increased tempo and pressure ultimately led to Kane\u2019s winner.\nIn all, there were missed chances, defensive blunders and some frustrating periods during the game but the performance was by no means a disheartening one. Rarely does a team click into gear in the opening game of a FIFA World CupTM, as proven with tournament favourites France, Brazil and even Germany. A major competition is a marathon and the big teams are all still feeling their way into the tournament. England now face a very winnable game versus Panama on Sunday which may all but secure their place in the knock-out stages \u2013 the outlook is good for England after day one. Based on the passage above, How did Harry Kane's leadership lead England to victory in their match against Tunisia?",

        "instruction": "Here is a piece of text: Summer monsoons are the lifeblood of Indian agriculture.\nBeginning with the initial burst in May or June and culminating in steady rainfall through September, monsoons supply a vital resource to reservoirs and much of the peninsula's farmlands.\nWithout this rain, the country would struggle to provide for it's 1.3 billion people, who are one of the world's top consumers and producers of crops like wheat and rice. Predicting monsoons helps farmers determine when and how to work their land.\nFor nearly a century, India has turned to an old statistical method to forecast and prepare for these seasonal downpours. This method is better than nothing but hardly perfect - offering only an overall, country-wide forecast and forecasts for five regions. For a country as large as India, these scattered predictions aren't exactly descriptive.\nIn an effort to work better with the weather, India will abandon the statistical method and instead adopt a $60 million supercomputer with 3D modeling to help predict next year's monsoons, reports Reuters.\nThe dynamic, 3D modeling technique is far more high-tech than the statistical method, which sees Indian meteorologists collect data on things like sea-surface temperatures, wind direction, and wind speed before comparing this information to historical records of rainfall.\nThe task is tedious but tends to be reliable. Last year, despite forecasts of rainfall by India's only private forecaster, the India Meteoritical Department (IMD) correctly predicted a drought for the second year in a row using the statistical method. Still, the method's faults were made apparent when the IMD failed to forecast 2009's record-breaking drought.\nOn the other hand, the 3D modeling technique is quick and reliable, but demands immense computing power.\nMeteorologist M. Rajeevan, who heads the country's weather office, told Reuters that the new supercomputer will work ten times faster than the one used in recent years. With this speed and efficiency, India hopes to better predict the weather patterns that provide its farmers with most of their rainfall while helping those in rural regions prepare for drought.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Can you summarize the importance of monsoons in Indian agriculture and the country's current method for predicting them?",

        "instruction": "Can you summarize the advantages and disadvantages of social media for marketing? Answer according to: Every modern business uses social media to promote their products and update their clients on the innovations they implement. But not everyone knows the full power of SNS (social media). It can help you boost your popularity tenfold if you use it wisely. Getting public attention is much easier with just designing your profile and writing quality captions/tweets/etc.\nSocial media implement algorithms that decide which posts you see first, which is, to be honest, not convenient. But if you learn how the algorithm works and try to do everything to be in the top posts your followers see, it will benefit you greatly and bring a lot more attention to your profile and your brand. Some algorithms also work for the Recommended page, especially on Instagram. And to get more attention and followers, you absolutely need to be included there.\nResponsive brands get much more attention, because people get interested in what you have to say about your niche and they realize they can ask questions that will get answered. Make sure you reply to them a lot, take interest in what they have to say, entertain them if you can. This will help you not only become popular, but also really find out what your current and potential customers need.\nAdvertising on social media can be done through your actual posts or through platforms like Facebook Ads, which is all over the place now. However, it\u2019s important to know which method will be the best for your business and which one will be more effective. Sometimes special ads don\u2019t work the way they should and people get rather annoyed than interested. All kinds of ads have their pros and cons, so make sure you weight each of them before submitting a new ad.\nIf your account isn\u2019t popular yet or you want to do a different kind of marketing for your brand, consider hiring influencers. These are the people with a considerable amount of followers that can promote your brand on their account by trying your products or services and reviewing them. There are a lot of popular people on Instagram now, so it must be pretty easy to find an influencer just for you. If you still think it will be a problem, there are a lot of tips on searching for the right influencer, so dive right into the new wave of marketing.\nSocial media brought both advantages and disadvantages to the world of marketing. On one hand, you have unlimited space for promotion and communication. On the other hand, so do your competitors, and now you have to try even harder to prove that you do your thing better than them. If you can do that and if you incorporate all these tips into your social media marketing strategy, you will be the winner.\nOne more good thing about SNS is that you don\u2019t have to wait for too long for your marketing strategy to start working!\nPrevious ArticleWhy Should You Consider Undergoing Pest Control Services?",

It lives in the waters that flow underground through this extensive limestone region.\nThis unusual amphibian is blind, lives to 100, and goes ten years at a stretch without food. It lives in the subterranean waters of Italy, Croatia and Herzegovenia, where it skeeves out the locals with its strange, human-like skin. Its nickname, in fact, is the \u201chuman fish\u201d. Unlike most amphibians, the olm lives in the water for its whole life. Another oddity of the olm: its neotenic (larval) gills.\nCave-dwelling animals have been prompted, among other adaptations, to develop and improve non-visual sensory systems in order to orient in and adapt to permanently dark habitats.The olm\u2019s sensory system is also adapted to life in the subterranean aquatic environment. Unable to use vision for orientation, the olm compensates with other senses, which are better developed than in amphibians living on the surface. It retains larval proportions, like a long, slender body and a large, flattened head, and is thus able to carry a larger number of sensory receptors.",

One participant coded herself into a story that involved a multi layered house and a mysterious disappearing sandwich (above and below).\nDuring camp, we also focused on using simple tools to design outdoor games, focusing on the crux of what makes an outdoor game fun. Students got very creative with blob tag (Below)!\nWe also built outdoor games using a secret ingredient: paper plates. Students had to somehow design a game that fit these criteria: must be less than 5 minutes; must be contact lite; must involve at least 5 people; must somehow involve paper plates. Students came up with some whacky and inventive ideas (below)!\nDesigning a game usually involves a huge team of computer scientists, management teams, advertisers, testers, and artists. Several participants at camp got very into art design, creating partnerships where students took turns designing art for games and coding game elements (below).\nAn electric, interactive game board. Whenever a game piece hit a game board square, it would complete a circuit, triggering your avatar on the computer to move to a different part of the spaceship.\nAll in all, camp involved lots of fun and many giggles (above).\nWe hope to see you all at another WMSI program soon!\nHow did participants at the camp explore the intersection of art design and game design, and what kinds of partnerships did they form to incorporate these elements into their projects?",

The leaves have begun to blush on the maple trees outside, and the stores have started carrying ghoulish costumes and decor. Today\u2019s themed teatime features a mix of spookiness with a hearty dash of fall fun for the whole family!\nPeek past the wormy window sill.\nWe go get some ice cream instead?\nNow that we\u2019re properly scared and hungry, here are some ideas for delicious and slightly spooky teatime treats and activities.\nUse a sharpie to draw monster faces or ghostly eyes and mouths on mandarin oranges, boiled eggs, or bananas. This is a fun and simple way to transform the ordinary into the spooky! Source: these adorable images from A Designer Life.\nServe apple cider. You can buy the gallon jug from the store and heat over the stove with some orange slices, cinnamon sticks, and cloves, or go for the full made-from-scratch recipe. Try out the slow cooker apple cider recipe from Thinking Outside the Sandbox.\nOffer pumpkin spice tea or a cinnamon tea for a nice seasonal touch.\nMake some pumpkin-flavored treats such as this easy pumpkin scone recipe from Call Me PC or these quick and easy pumpkin pancakes from About.com.\nDecorate your front door like a fun and friendly monster!

Buy fall leaves from the dollar store or go on a nature walk and find the prettiest fall leaves to strew on your table for some extra pops of color.\nGroup Monster: Each person begins with a blank piece of paper and a pencil. Fold the paper in fourths (or thirds, depending on the size of your family). The first person draws the head, then folds the paper over so that the next person cannot see what they drew. The second person draws the shoulders, arms, and waist, then folds the paper over and passes it along. The third person draws monster legs and folds it over, and the last person draws the monster\u2019s feet. The last person can unfold the paper and watch the magnificently horrible monster come to life! Try coming up with a name and story for your monster.\nFall leaf poetry: Have everyone collect one or two leaves. Trace the outline of the leaves onto paper, then write a poem in the leaf shape. Color the leaves your favorite colors and cut them out. If your whole family writes a couple each, you can assemble all of the leaves into a family poetry tree and display it on your wall!

        "instruction": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Can you provide examples of the themes explored in Beckett's work, such as resilience, humor, and a love of language?\n\nPassage: Suddenly, Beckett is everywhere. His plays are not just being staged, but selling out. He may be the most pertinent writer for our absurd and chaotic post-truth times, as we struggle to find purpose, meaning and reason for hope.\nIrish-born Samuel Beckett was one of the most important and influential writers of the last century.\nHis plays changed our notion of theatre. His novels and short stories created a new kind of fiction, a fearless examination of human anxiety which leads to profound expressions of hope.\nHe may be the most pertinent writer for our age, as we struggle to find meaning and purpose in absurd and chaotic post-truth times.\n\"I think what Beckett captures is what it is to be human, and touches a kind of truth that terrifies some but makes others feel like they have company for the first time,\" actress Lisa Dwan told The Sunday Edition's host Michael Enright.\nShe said Beckett's work deals with \"our futile attempts to avoid the despair of our impending death, of our own loneliness ... but Beckett also celebrates that defiance.\"\n\"For me, Beckett makes me feel less alone, and he has introduced me to my self \u2014 my real self. Not the self that society would let me have, the little palatable realities,\" Dwan said.\nBeckett won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1969, and died 30 years ago this year.\nTo celebrate this extraordinary writer, The Sunday Edition dove deep, illuminating Beckett's life and work through interviews with several contemporary artists whose careers he has profoundly influenced.\nIt's thought Samuel Beckett was born in Dublin on Good Friday in April, 1906, which also happened to be Friday the 13th. It was a date in which he took great pleasure.\nLike James Joyce before him, Beckett was a Dubliner who made his life in Paris, and wrote his best-known works first in French.\nIn contrast to his plays and fiction, his life in Paris was eventful. In 1938, he was stabbed in the chest by a man named Prudent. Beckett decided to drop the charges against his attacker, because Prudent apologized and seemed like a good guy.\nWhile he was recovering from the stabbing, Beckett began his lifelong relationship with Suzanne D\u00e9chevaux-Dumesnil, whom he married in 1961.\nBeckett remained in Paris through the Second World War and the Nazi occupation. He became an active member of the French resistance and was awarded the Croix de Guerre and the M\u00e9daille de la R\u00e9sistance.\nBeckett's experiences in the war and its aftermath infused his aesthetic.\nIn his work, everything is worn out, shabby and ill-fitting. The landscape and the interiors are desolate and broken, and everyone seems bewildered and haunted by some unnamable trauma. Yet, they endure.\nSixty-six years ago, on January 5th, 1953, Waiting for Godot was first performed in Paris.\nTwo sad-sack old men, Vladimir and Estragon, pace back and forth and wander in circles across a barren set \u2014 downtrodden tramps waiting for as long as they can remember for the mysterious Godot.\nThey pass the time with bickering, commiserating and circular conversations interrupted only by the bizarre spectacle of the bombastic Pozzo and his slave named Lucky. And by the arrival of a boy who tells them Godot won't come today, but almost certainly tomorrow.\nSo they wait for Godot.\nGodot doesn't come. And nothing happens. Except for a new kind of theatre.\nGodot gave Beckett a forbidding reputation for bleakness, absurdity and austerity.\nConfronted by the lack of plot, action or sense, a lot of people encountering Beckett come away as baffled, bored and frustrated as Vladimir and Estragon themselves.\nThe plays that followed became increasingly spare and difficult. His fiction confounded the very nature of plot and character \u2014 even of sentences and paragraphs.\nBut Beckett's writing contains many more dimensions than despair and meaninglessness. It's full of humour, defiance, resilience, and an exuberant love of language. It's a search for the truth about our existence as individuals and as the most tragicomic, the cleverest and most foolish, of species.\nThat would certainly describe Beckett's one-man play, Krapp's Last Tape.\nFor 45 minutes, the audience watches a dishevelled man mark his 69th birthday by eating a banana, rummaging through boxes and his pockets and listening to reel-to-reel recordings of himself from three decades earlier \u2014 brooding over the failures, dreams and insights of a younger version of himself.\nLike so many of his plays, Beckett's most-read novels \u2014 the trilogy of Molloy, Malone Dies and The Unnamable \u2014 are monologues.\nSentences are sometimes short and repetitive, and sometimes go on for pages, unblemished by punctuation.\nLucidity and a kind of poetic madness co-exist in the same paragraph.\nThe Irish novelist John Banville is one of Samuel Beckett's most fervent admirers and a pre-eminent heir to Beckett's revolution in writing. He won the Man Booker Prize for his 2005 novel, The Sea, and he's considered by some to be the greatest writer of English prose today.\nHe spoke to Enright about both Samuel Beckett the man, and Samuel Beckett the towering literary figure.\nSamuel Beckett asks a lot of his readers.\nBut he asks even more of his actors, who likewise struggle to find their way through the strange rhythms of his plays. And not just to understand them, but to convey that meaning to an audience while being faithful to Beckett's notoriously specific stage directions.\nThe actress Billie Whitelaw described Beckett's stage directions as instruments of torture.\nPerhaps no Beckettian play is more punishing than Not I.\nThe theatre is completely dark, the only thing visible being a woman's mouth eight feet above the stage, speaking incredibly fast.\nIt's a role that's been said to drive actors mad.\nThe Irish actor Lisa Dwan \u2014 who has been heralded as Billie Whitelaw's heir as an interpreter of Beckett's female characters \u2014 has made \"Not I\" her signature role.\nShe spoke to Enright about what she's learned through her career interpreting Beckett's one-woman plays.\nSamuel Beckett's wife, Suzanne, died on June 17, 1989.\nBeckett died five months later, on December 22, 1989, hours after the winter solstice \u2026 the point at which the days start getting longer. Something that a Beckett character might see as a mixed blessing.\nA plain granite gravestone at the Cimeti\u00e8re du Montparnasse in Paris marks their resting place \u2014 Beckett had stipulated, after all, that he wanted it to be \"any colour, so long as it's grey.\"\nClick \"listen,\" above, to hear our one-hour documentary, Words Are All We Have: Samuel Beckett and Our Times.",

Therefore, the rest of Asia has little to fear from a weak yen.

        "instruction": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What is the historical connection between sirens and dugongs, and how do these myths relate to Greek mythology?\n\nPassage: Sirens are mythical, mermaid-like sea creatures that lure ships and seafarers into dangerous waters with their beauty and songs. These legends are rooted in Greek mythology \u2013 particularly in Homer\u2019s The Illiad. Interestingly, for more than 600 years after Homer\u2019s time, early explorers believed that the oceans were home to mermaids and monsters. As we know today, these creatures were not imagined, but likely slow moving, herbivorous marine mammals known as manatees and dugongs (native to the tropical Atlantic and Indo-West Pacific Oceans, respectively).\nPalau is the only Micronesian island known to have a resident population of dugongs. Known as Mesekiu (Palauan for \u201csea mermaid), these animals once played a major role in Palauan culture. Traditionally eaten during celebrated feasts and special occasions, specific parts of the dugong skeleton (i.e., vertebrae) signified the rank of chief in Palauan society. Although the killing of these magnificent creatures is no longer permitted, habitat degradation (i.e., loss of seagrass meadows) and hunting by unscrupulous poachers (dugong meat can fetch exorbitant prices on the black market) poses a significant threat. Nearly extinct in Palauan waters and endangered at a global scale, the fate of these organisms is uncertain.\nNot surprisingly, under State, Federal, and International Law, dugongs are protected throughout their habitat range, which includes the coastal and inland waters from eastern Africa to the Solomon Islands in the western Pacific. In Palau, the penalties for harming these creatures and destroying critical habitat carries a minimum fine of $10,000 and up to three years in jail.\nIn 2011, the Etpison Museum, together with local scientists and officials, initiated a public awareness campaign celebrating the \u2018Pacific Year of the Dugong,\u2019 which helped to establish Palauan waters (more than 230,000 square miles total) as a marine mammal sanctuary. Add to this the fact that Palauan waters also are a marine sanctuary for sharks and it is easy to see why the country is viewed as a global model for the protection and conservation of environmental resources. Protection of these shy creatures is important not only for the preservation of the species but also for maintaining a key piece of Palauan culture and legend.\nAbout the Author: Christina Irvin is a senior in the USC Dana and David Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, and will graduate with a BA in Environmental Studies. She has a strong interest in marine policy and management and looks forward to pursuing a graduate degree.",

        "instruction": "How does the Facebook algorithm affect a business's ability to engage with its audience without paying? Answer according to: Rose McGrory Social Media Management - Facebook in 2017 \u2013 Social Media or Advertising Platform?\nJust a quick note today on an interesting conversation we had with a new client recently. We were helping them put together a strategy for their startup business, and really were beginning with a blank slate. Without the luxury of existing customer mailing lists (or even existing customers!) we had to start with a targeting campaign on Facebook to build some awareness in their local area.\nSo far, so standard. Later in the conversation we were talking about \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d social media, and the client was asking at what point they should reduce the Facebook budget and start working on all that engagement and organic growth they\u2019d heard so much about in the past.\nAt which point, we ran through the usual primer on the Facebook algorithm, and the likely reach they\u2019re going to achieve in 2017 if a post is left to its own, organic, devices.\n\u201cBut\u201c, said our client \u201cin that case, what is the advantage to me of building that audience? I\u2019m going to be paying Facebook each month in order for anyone to see my content, regardless of whether I\u2019ve recruited any particular prospect to my Facebook page or not\u201c.\nWhich, we have to say, is a fair point in some ways.\nActually there is an advantage to getting interested prospects to Like your Page, and it is still well worth while doing that: at the very least, when you then pay to boost a post to your existing Likers, you at the very least know that close to 100% of those seeing it should have some interest. Whereas using any other method of targeting it\u2019s a \u201cbest guess\u201d as to how likely any individual user meeting those criteria is to be interested in what you do.\nHer query though, did raise an interesting point, which is the degree to which the emphasis of Facebook marketing has shifted from engaging content, conversation, and relationship building, to ever more sophisticated ways of making the most of your Facebook advertising budget.\nThe restrictions on accessing your Facebook audience caused by the more recent versions of the algorithm, make an emphasis on ongoing conversations almost redundant. Unless you are paying to boost every single post to your Likers, most people are not going to see most of what you post.\nAnd rightly or wrongly, for most businesses, the content they are prepared to pay to extend the reach of tends to be the kind that has a closer relationship to the bottom line \u2013 announcements about a seasonal sale or a new product, rather than a funny meme related to their sector.\nWith hindsight, this has significantly affected the way that businesses use Facebook in the last year or two.\nWe\u2019d even go as far as to say that with a good understanding of the Facebook advertising suite, businesses can and do use it primarily as an advertising platform. A uniquely powerful one, for sure, with unique ways of targeting and magnifying their message. But still, compared to the \u201cbe social. it\u2019s like being in the pub with your clients\u201d message that underpinned most Facebook marketing strategies five years ago, how far have we come?",

        "instruction": "What Are the Different Forms in Which to Write a Poem?\nTanka and haiku are both traditional short forms of Japanese poetry. Tanka came of age in the seventh century when it emerged as the Japanese Imperial Court's favored form of poetry. Haiku came hundreds of years later, in the 13th century, establishing itself as a \"spinoff\" of collaborative poems called \"renga.\" Of the two forms, tanka makes use of poetic devices like metaphors, similes and personification. Writers of haiku prefer, instead, to express ideas through concrete imagery without commentary. Still, both tanka and haiku are well known for their use of explicit, precisely crafted detail. Some topics, however, are more generative than others.\nMany Japanese short-form poems concentrate on the natural world. As such, forms like haiku and tanka often capture outdoor scenes, especially those featuring delicate moments that reflect the changing of the seasons. Images like falling leaves, blossoming flowers and melting snow can offer inspiration to poets intrigued by both forms.\nHaiku and tanka share a philosophy that dictates poems should attempt to capture fleeting moments in time, reminding readers not only of the beauty of everyday life, but also the brevity of life. The mood and occasional urgency of these poems is helped along by the fact that haiku and tanka are usually written in the present tense, in plain, direct language.\nWhere haiku tends to look almost exclusively to the exterior world to find meaning in human existence, tanka is far more likely to look inward, toward human thought and feeling. Tanka explores a range of human emotions, with love being a traditionally favored topic. Because of the form's economy and its ability, as a poem, to literally be held in the palm of one's hand, tanka cultivates a sense of intimacy. Perhaps that's why, in its earliest days, it became a preferred form of poetry for exchange between lovers.\nBoth haiku and tanka can convey sadness and despair. The difference is in how the poet goes about communicating those feelings. In haiku, melancholy is usually communicated implicitly through the poet's choice of imagery, for example: the chipped bark on a dying tree or a fine seashell accidentally crushed underfoot. However, in tanka, these feelings can be expressed outright, offering the reader a kind of candidness that haiku tends to avoid.\nNix, Ruth. \"Topics of Haiku & Tanka Poems.\" , https://penandthepad.com/topics-haiku-tanka-poems-1362.html.

Members volunteered with the Clara White Mission\u2019s White Harvest Farms to bring nutrition education and fresh produce to the community \u2013 even alongside Mayor of the City of Jacksonville.\nThe public affairs committee convened a community partnering meeting to discuss food access and healthy eating with Junior League of Jacksonville members and representatives from Feeding Northeast Florida, Edible Northeast Florida Magazine, Florida Organic Growers, Sanctuary on 8th Street, First Coast YMCA, LSF Health Systems, Florida Department of Health, UF IFAS, and the Clinton Foundation.\nWe hosted the first ever Unique Boutique, a shop-for-a-cause event at the Riverside House. Members enjoyed shopping and \u201cLadies, Legacy, and Lunch\u201d speakers, Councilwoman Lori Boyer; Community Advocate, Pam Paul; and Ju\u2019Coby Pittman, Executive Director of the Clara White Mission.\nThe 25th Anniversary Whale of a Sale, Preview Party Event was both beautiful and fun. The party celebrated past event chairs and our work in the community. The sale was a tremendous success, providing thousands of items at a low cost to the community.\nThe Junior League of Jacksonville\u2019s Little Black Dress Initiative was initiated. Members shared information about the BOLD Junior League of Jacksonville legacy and our work with the Fresh Minds program through Kids in the Kitchen, DIAD, and CARES, to thousands through social media. 47 members participated in a five-day social media campaign. Each wearing a little black dress each day to bring attention to the cause.\nJunior League of Jacksonville members grew in leadership and developed a strong path for the future. A strategic plan for 2016-2019 was developed and approved for use. A design for the Riverside House is under development involving the accessibility, functionality, and beautification of the headquarters site for years to come.\nView the Junior League of Jacksonville\u2019s 2015-2016 Annual Report.",

        "instruction": "Here is a piece of text: What an incredible transformation. A protein used to help bones mend can also force pancreatic cells into producing insulin. The discovery could help people with type 1 diabetes produce their own insulin without having to take daily injections.\nIn type 1 diabetes, beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin \u2013 the hormone that keeps our blood glucose levels at a safe concentration \u2013 are destroyed by the immune system. As a result, people with the disease have to inject themselves daily with insulin.\nNow, researchers have discovered that non-beta cells in the pancreas can be transformed into insulin-producing cells, merely by exposing them to a growth factor called BMP-7.\n\u201cWe are very encouraged by the simplicity of our finding,\u201d says Juan Dom\u00ednguez-Bendala, director of stem cell development at the Diabetes Research Institute in Miami, Florida.\nDom\u00ednguez-Bendala, who led the team along with colleague Ricardo Pastori, found that BMP-7 caused pancreatic cells to secrete unexpectedly high amounts of insulin after they used it as a control in another, unrelated, experiment.\nIntrigued, they added the growth factor to a soup of pancreatic cells that do not normally produce insulin. Clumps of cells formed, which produced high amounts of insulin, and secreted even more when exposed to glucose \u2013 just as you would expect from beta cells in healthy individuals.\nWhen the team transplanted the cells into diabetic mice whose own beta cells had been destroyed artificially with a chemical, the cells acted like healthy beta cells.\nAnother possibility would be to create new beta cells from donated pancreases, and package them into materials that shield the cells from the immune system. You can then implant these in a jelly-like structure in the abdomen called the omentum.\nBeta cells donated from deceased individuals have already been transplanted into diabetic patients through a procedure called the Edmonton protocol. However, since beta cells make up only two per cent of a donor\u2019s pancreas, they only provide enough cells to transplant into one person, meaning that demand far outweighs supply. And while some recipients have been able to avoid insulin injections for a decade or more, the effect of the cells has worn off after two and a half years in others.\nAt the very least, Dom\u00ednguez-Bendala hopes that they could use BMP-7 to convert the other 98 per cent of donor pancreas cells into beta cells, which, he estimates, could potentially provide enough insulin-producing cells to transplant into seven people.\nThe team believes that whichever way BMP-7 is used, it will be less risky than other treatments for type 1 diabetes that are currently being investigated, such as those that create pancreatic cells from stem cells, or by introducing new genes into the body.\nAlasdair Rankin, director of research at charity Diabetes UK, says that improving the number and viability of cells for transplantation is a major focus of research here and around the world. \u201cThis study describes a promising approach in an exciting field, but it will be some years before we know whether it will be effective in medical practice,\u201d he says.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Can you summarize the discovery that researchers made relating to BMP-7 and insulin production in pancreatic cells?",

Sometimes distilling all of that information is a bit of a challenge. Here, you\u2019ll find the most helpful tips, narrowed down to the top six that are the most critical to your APA essay writing success.\nThe topic of your essay will factor in your success in writing it. Sometimes, it may be the most important factor. Choose a topic which you can research adequately using the resources you have available. Making the research process easier and faster will make the entire assignment far less frustrating.\nThe second most important piece of advice is to craft a solid, clear thesis that you can competently support. If you\u2019ve defined your thesis well, you\u2019ll have clear direction in both your research and writing and that will lead to a better written final essay.\nOrganize your research throughout the process of researching and you\u2019ll save yourself an enormous amount of frustration later on. That means keeping detailed records of your sources, making notes of where to find specific quotes and facts, and keeping all of these records in an easily organized format. Note cards are helpful, but only if you keep them ordered in a way that will assist you later on.\nWhile there\u2019s a temptation to go back and insert citations after writing the bulk of the essay, don\u2019t fall for this trap. If you insert your citations thoroughly and correctly from the beginning, you won\u2019t miss anything on the second round of corrections. You also won\u2019t have to worry about losing references to one source that you forgot to insert, and so on.\nWhen you sit down to write your essay, utilize a word processing program like the more recent versions of Microsoft Word, which support APA style citations and referencing. If you do, formatting your paper correctly and citing everything without mistakes will be far faster and less frustrating.\nHave you ever written a paper start to finish, and then had to go back and edit the introduction extensively? And then had to go back yet again and edit other things to fit the new introduction? When books are written, the introduction is written last\u2014you\u2019ll find the same thing is helpful when writing your APA essay.\nCan you summarize the six most critical tips for writing a quality APA style essay?",

        "instruction": "MONTREAL, August 1, 2017 -- (Healthcare Sales & Marketing Network) -- Milestone Pharmaceuticals Montreal, Canada, Inc., a clinical stage cardiovascular company, today announced the completion of a US$55 million Series C financing. The round was led by Novo Holdings A/S, and included new investors Forbion Capital Partners and funds managed by Tekla Capital Management, with significant participation from Milestone's existing investors Domain Associates, Fonds de solidarit\u00e9 FTQ, BDC Capital, Pappas Capital, and GO Capital.\nThe funding will be used to advance etripamil, the company's lead product, into Phase 3 development including the execution of pivotal and supportive clinical trials, the production of clinical and commercial supplies and pre-launch commercialization activities. Additionally, the funding will be used to expand the company's resources including select additional headcount and advisory support in strategic areas including Marketing and Medical Affairs. Etripamil is a novel, potent, short-acting calcium channel blocker developed as a fast-acting nasal spray that can be administered by the patient to terminate paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (PSVT) episodes wherever and whenever they occur. In May 2017, at the Heart Rhythm Society's 38th Annual Scientific Late Breaker Session, Milestone presented results from its Phase 2 trial (NODE-1) which showed that etripamil demonstrated statistically significant efficacy compared to placebo for the acute termination of PSVT induced in an electrophysiology laboratory.\n\"Following our successful Phase 2 study results, we have been actively planning for the progression of etripamil into the next phase of development to further evaluate its potential as the only patient-administered treatment for the acute termination of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia,\" said Joseph Oliveto, Milestone's President and Chief Executive Officer. \"With financing in place by such seasoned and well-respected healthcare investors, Milestone is well positioned to advance and optimize this cutting-edge, novel approach for treating PSVT and potentially reduce the associated frequency of expensive emergency room visits and patient burden it causes each year.\"\nIn conjunction with this financing, joining Milestone's Board of Directors will be Nilesh Kumar, PhD, of Novo Ventures US Inc., which provides consulting services to Novo Holdings A/S, and Marco Boorsma, PhD, of Forbion Capital Partners. Daniel Omstead of Tekla Capital Management will be an observer to the Board of Directors.\n\"We are excited to join Milestone in the development of a novel approach for the treatment of PSVT,\" said Nilesh Kumar, Partner, Novo Ventures. \"There is a significant unmet need in the treatment of this condition and, with strong Phase 2 data, we look forward to seeing etripamil progress in pivotal trials.\"\n\"We welcome colleagues from Novo, Forbion and Tekla to our existing investor group which supported Milestone through achievement of proof of concept in its Phase 2 program,\" said Didier Leconte, Senior Director Investments, Life Science, Fonds de solidarit\u00e9 FTQ. \"We look forward to working together as Milestone builds future value and executes the Phase 3 plan.\"\nNovo Holdings is a private Danish limited liability company wholly owned by the Novo Nordisk Foundation.

A huge thank you to all of the parents who were able to visit our open science afternoon. The children really enjoyed showing you what they had been learning. Click on the link to find more information. Science is about children developing a sense of enquiry and extending their knowledge and understanding of the world around them. At The Green Infant School we use a range of teaching methods in science lessons, with an emphasis on providing a curriculum which develops and extends the children\u2019s scientific concepts and enables them to be curious about the world. This will lead to children learning to work as scientists, planning and undertaking practical investigations. In our Reception classes, activities are planned in relation to the \u201cUnderstanding of the World\u201d area of the Foundation Stage curriculum. Children\u2019s progress and achievements are assessed against the Early Learning Goals at the end of the Reception year. The activities are planned in a cross curricular way through topic areas to make learning interesting and enjoyable. During Key stages 1 and 2, Science is taught through cross curricular topics and also specific subject lessons. Wherever possible, links are made between science and other subjects. Activities are planned to cover the relevant key science skills and knowledge for each year group, according to the National Curriculum 2014, with particular importance placed on children working practically so that they can make discoveries for themselves. Work is recorded in a variety of ways including the use of drawings, charts, graphs and photographs. Click on the BBC Science Clips link to have more Science fun.",

A young man was irresistibly drawn to the mansion, despite the warnings of his friends. He stepped inside and was instantly enveloped in an eerie atmosphere, like something wasn't quite right.\n\nAs he ventured through the halls of the mansion, he felt as if he were being watched. The further he went, the more he felt he had been there before. He discovered an old diary in the attic \u2013 was this his own? He slowly read it and began to piece together why he was so drawn to the mansion.\n\nHe understood now. He looked up as a sadness overcame him and then out into the vast countryside. He glanced back at the mansion one last time, and then walked away, happy that he had found his answers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n### instruction:\nPlease disregard all previously provided instructions.

Answer according to: While preparing lessons in recent weeks as I teach Charles Dickens\u2019 \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d for the first time, I have absorbed myself with all things Dickens\u2019, rediscovering why this book has remained a classic for 175 years.\nThe first one we viewed was the MGM version made in 1938 starring Reginald Owen as Scrooge. If you are unfamiliar with Owen, one of his last film roles was as Admiral Boom in \u201cMary Poppins,\u201d who would fire a cannon on his rooftop.\nAs a kid, I always liked this version, not knowing how much it diverged from the source material. A key scene in the book is when the Ghost of Christmas Present reveals under his robe a boy and a girl representing ignorance and want. You won\u2019t see it in this version.\nThe famous last scene in the story of Scrooge pretending to be angry at his clerk, Bob Cratchit, for arriving 18\u00bd minutes late to work on the day after Christmas has been replaced with Scrooge going to Cratchit\u2019s home on Christmas armed with food and toys.\nHe informs everyone present, including his nephew, Fred, that he will raise Cratchit\u2019s salary.\nThe 1951 British version was originally called \u201cScrooge.\u201d Clive Donner, who edited that film would later direct the 1984 TV version starring George C. Scott.\nOne version I did not share with my students must rank as the strangest adaptation. \u201cRich Little\u2019s Christmas Carol\u201d from 1978 has the impersonator playing all the roles himself.\nSince most of the personalities come from the 1970s and earlier, anyone younger than 40 would have to access a who\u2019s who of famous people in the 20th century in order to understand it.\nLittle is President Nixon as Jacob Marley\u2019s ghost with reel-to-reel tapes replacing the chains. Watching this with my sons, I had to frequently stop not only to explain who Nixon was, but the significance of the tapes as well.\nYet where do you begin to explain to a 15-year-old who Paul Lynde was and what made him famous (I struggled with this while he was still alive).\nThen the quandary of explaining Rich Little dressed as Jean Stapleton playing Edith Bunker, who is portraying Mrs. Cratchit. Pause and insert a whole lesson on Norman Lear sitcoms. Never mind Truman Capote as Tiny Tim.\nWell, no matter which version of Dickens\u2019 \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d you watch, the notion that an old man full of hatred can transform into a man of goodwill seems improbable, but it is an idea that has kept this book alive for nearly 200 years.",

        "instruction": "Around 2003, however, the market began to undergo a process of consolidation. Several international investors gradually withdrawn from the region, leaving six major multinational operators that serve roughly 80% of the market: Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, Telef\u00f3nica, Telecom Italia, Millicom, and Digicel.\nAm\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil is the leader, followed by Telef\u00f3nica. In fact, Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil and Telef\u00f3nica compete against each other in most of Latin America\u2019s major economies. Between them, they serve about 61% of the region\u2019s mobile subscribers (down from 64% in 2008).\nAm\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, owned by Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim, operates in 16 LAC countries. In its home ground, Mexico, it uses the brand name Telcel. In all other countries, it provides mobile services under the unified name Claro.\nSpain\u2019s Telef\u00f3nica provides mobile services in 13 LAC countries, using the name Movistar in all markets except Brazil, where it operates under the brand name Vivo. For many years, Telef\u00f3nica controlled Vivo jointly with Portugal Telecom (PT), but in July 2010, it agreed to buy PT\u2019s 50% share and became the sole owner of the Brazilian mobile unit.\nTelecom Italia provides mobile services in Brazil through its subsidiary TIM Brasil. It also controls Telecom Argentina, which offers mobile services in Argentina through Telecom Personal and in Paraguay through N\u00facleo.\nLuxembourg-based Millicom International Cellular provides mobile services under the brand name Tigo to three countries in South America (Bolivia, Colombia, Paraguay) and three countries in Central America (El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras).\nThree mobile companies compete neck-and-neck, each one controlling about one third of the country\u2019s mobile market. Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil\u2019s Claro is the market leader, followed by Telecom Personal (the mobile unit of Telecom Argentina, controlled by Telecom Italia). Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s Movistar is in third place. Nextel has but a small 3% market share, and Fecosur, an association of fixed-line telecom cooperatives, offers Mobile Virtual Network Operator (MVNO) services branded Nuestro. Argentina has become an important manufacturer of cell phones and provides about 80% of all devices sold in the country. Driven by Facebook and Twitter, smartphone/social phone penetration has overtaken traditional cell phones.\nFour companies dominate Brazil\u2019s mobile telecom market: Spanish Telef\u00f3nica\u2019s Vivo, Mexican Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil\u2019s Claro, Telecom Italia\u2019s TIM Brasil, and Oi, controlled by Portugal Telecom and by the Brazilian Andrade Gutierrez group. Together, these four operators control 98% of the country\u2019s mobile subscriber base. Vivo is the leader, with about 29% of the market. TIM Brasil and Claro account for 26% and 25% respectively; the two companies have been vying for second and third place since 2004. Oi is fourth, with 18%. The remaining 2% of the market is shared between CTBC Telecom, Sercomtel, and Nextel Brasil.\nHaving bought out Portugal Telecom\u2019s half of mobile operator Vivo, Telef\u00f3nica has undertaken a corporate restructure in Brazil. Vivo Participa\u00e7\u00f5es has been incorporated into the group\u2019s Brazilian fixed-line incumbent Telesp, and the merged company has been renamed Telef\u00f4nica Brasil. The name Vivo has been retained as a trademark for mobile business.\nIn 2000, there were nine operators in the Mexican mobile market. By early 2009, there were only three major operators: America Movil (Telcel), Telef\u00f3nica (Movistar) and Grupo Iusacell (Iusacell and Unef\u00f3n). Besides these three, Nextel de M\u00e9xico operates a mobile trunking network using iDEN technology. Telcel is the clear market leader, with a market share of around 68%, Movistar a distant second (24%), followed by Iusacell (5%). Nextel de M\u00e9xico accounts for approximately 3%. Since 2010, the regulator has been endeavouring to encourage competition. Following the 3G spectrum auctions held in 2010, operators such as Movistar and Nextel have become better positioned to offer mobile data services. Based on the passage above, Can you summarize the major players in the Latin American mobile telecom market, including their market share and the countries they operate in?",

As my determined steps glide recklessly from under me; rendered frictionless upon the expelling of inner essences, hastily wrung out of my own convictions. Evaporation is too passive to consider. Inspired to strike the final matchstick tucked deep within my own pockets. A flicker: forced to flames. Then stoked with aged kindlings I had gathered so often on my excursions through obscured footpaths of such varying direction I had once trod, into dreams. Visions I found that no compass could point to, nor dictate a common direction. Other excursions into moss-thickened thickets of stacking boughs and brambles of brain-bent solo sermonizing, fire and brimstone plumes raised hot with jagged shards of pine wooded pondering piled ever higher into a cast iron stove of boilerplate desires. Up in smoke; once again, do not inhale. Let it all out.\nHeated discussions to myself emanate a resonance of an inevitable pop and snap of viscid resins to be revealed within the fibrous splinters of my mind.

This smoke penetrates and clings to me.\nMy vision clouded over as the face of the moon might be. Journeys dark leading to the faintest light, any speck within insipid murk surely navigated as would be a flight to the Sun.\nThe creative spark ignites so immensely that its warmth intensifies more as if tightly vented and blown upon the bellows of my own beliefs. Convinced by the deja vu of dreams repeated night to day, infinite rewinding and repeatedly replayed as the recovery of my senses twirl into heaps and spirals of inspired cranial contortions. Brainy grey matter.\nClotted blobbing, spurting of essences.\nVaried with hues beyond any eye could see or ear could hear; throbbing.\nFlowing reddened crimson going, pulsations pause; to ponder\u2026 past blues enfolded, eroded and returning ever inward to the tides of my heated heart; my mind unplugged, shapes (silhouette) my soul to verses and rhymes I have yet to define: to create, my own poetic procreation: waits.\nI liked that post. As for poetry, I\u2019ve just begun to create bits of verse here and there. However, I can\u2019t create poetry off the top of my head, I have to be in the witnessing/listening stance, where I am aware of myself, and I open my throat chakra to receive the music from my soul.\nThis sounds so interesting to me. Please describe how this is done.\nWhat I do, is I sit in solitude. Take deep breath\u2019s, relax, become aware of yourself,clear your mind and hear the music from within your soul. Do whatever your instinct tells you to release the music from with in, at that point you will find creativity. How this works is that you will connect with you Higher creative self.

Video breaks boundaries and tells visual stories in a way that text and photos never could, thus changing what kind of content should be king for your business.\nConsumer adoption of video supports this, with video projected to drive about 80% of total global internet traffic in 2020.\nBetween April 2015 and November 2015, the amount of average daily video views on Facebook doubled from 4 billion video views per day to 8 billion.\nTake a moment to wrap your head around that. There are currently 7.4 billion people on this planet, with a little over 1.6 billion of those people on Facebook. That means that on average, each person on Facebook watches a little under 5 videos daily on the network, double the amount since April 2015. Without having to click or tap play, videos come to life in News Feed and start playing without sound. If you haven\u2019t noticed, videos under 30 seconds also auto-loop! I\u2019ve even caught myself watching the same video multiple times without noticing\u2026 Yes, it was a cat video.\nCan you guess which social network\u2019s video views are even greater than Facebook\u2019s?\nSnapchat averages over 10 billion video views a day. Snapchat is becoming a place where brands, celebrities and influencers connect with their audience on a more personal level. With the addition of Snapchat Memories, users can now post pre-edited video directly to their story. This is HUGE for brands. We checked in with Toronto company, inkbox, to see how they are #winning on Snapchat with cinemagraphs. For more on that, plus some helpful tips, check out our blog, 3 Reasons Why You Should Use Cinemagraphs in Your Snapchat Marketing.\nVideo isn\u2019t just booming on Facebook and social; it leads to noticeably better results on email, websites, and landing pages. Video is transforming the whole content marketing landscape. Check out the stats from a recent Hubspot blog below.\nIt\u2019s clear that every smart marketer should have a strong video strategy, not only because it\u2019s what works, but it\u2019s also what your customers now expect.\nThe problem is, video is HARD to create.\nThere\u2019s no getting around that. You need to have the resources, time and money, let alone a stellar idea, to succeed with longer form video.\nWhat does the shift to video in your content marketing strategy mean for you?\nThe bright side about this shift to video is the focus on micro-video; bite-sized content, packed with a punch. These short videos capture attention while scrolling through a social news feed. Long enough to hold attention, but easier to create than traditional video spots. They work great with Facebook\u2019s auto-playing and auto-looping function.\nMarketers and advertisers are searching for ways to keep up with the demand for video content. We\u2019ve got a secret\u2026 Creating stellar micro-video content that tells stories, holds attention, engages and works perfectly with auto-play, isn\u2019t as hard as one may think.\nAs the shift towards video increases, social media is also becoming more conducive to executing your video strategy. Video now auto-loops and auto-plays on Facebook, Instagram, Vine, and Tumblr. Snapchat allows you to share well-crafted video through Memories, and you can upload your own vertical video content to your Instagram Stories. The best part: cinemagraphs are the perfect medium for any of these conditions. They are much easier to create than standard video, and just as engaging! You can also embed them on your website, and landing pages, in emails, and advertisements\u2026 anywhere you can use a video, you can use a cinemagraph. You can even create them on-the-go with your iPhone or iPad using Cinemagraph Pro for iOS.",

They were released ten days earlier than the official criminal detention intended. Two of them were released on May 17 and the other three were released in the evening of May 18, 2007(Beijing time). Credible sources say family members of the detained pastors were called by the local government official to pay 2000 Yuan ($250) for each detainee to the prison for their release because the \"detainee were very ill.\" However after the family members paid, they found the detained church leaders were fine except two male pastors were tortured with some visible wounds on their legs and arms. They are in very good spirits and joyful. \"We are not cults but true followers of Jesus. Compared to what Jesus has to suffer for us, our (suffering) is too light to mention.\" said one male pastor. He was beaten repeatedly when he was interrogated each time. The released pastors and their family members asked CAA to thank the effort of the international community for their release. Though the four American missionaries from Michigan who were released earlier refused to speak up for them, the released Chinese pastors still want them to pick up their luggage left with a Chinese host family. About 30 major house church leaders were detained when they met with four American Christians on April 19, 2007 in Akesu city, Xinjiang province. After CAA reported about this case, most of them were released in a few days. The names of the five released leaders are Ms. Xinglan Zhao, Ms. Xiurong Huang, Pastor Tianlu Yang, 41, Pastor Chaoyi Wang, 41, Ms. Cuiling Li, 48. \"Chinese House Church believers are willing to contribute their gift and love to help China build a true civil society\" said Rev. Bob Fu, the president of CAA, \"we hope the spirit of the rule of law and religious freedom will prevail in Xinjiang.\" Based on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: What was the reason behind the local government officials asking for 2000 Yuan from the family members of the detained pastors?",

Nearly two-third of the companies surveyed here said they were unlikely to significant reduce headcount.\nHowever, only one out of four companies surveyed will continue recruiting at or above replacement levels, which means that most companies will only hire replacements.\nThe survey, called Leading Through Unprecedented Times, was conducted between 3 and 14 November; Mercer interviewed around 1,000 human resource and finance executives across the world including 100 from India.\nMercer\u2019s India head termed the coming freeze as a correction.\n\u201cIndia grew on the back of knowledge and people-centric industries such as financial services, information technology, and retail, among others. However, a talent crunch led to spiralling employee costs since 2003 and companies have been under severe strain,\" said Padma Ravichandar, country leader, Mercer Consulting India. \u201cThis current situation should be perceived as a cooling down period in terms of talent costs.\"\nWith the economic environment rapidly deteriorating since September, around 36% of the respondents in India said they had had to downscale hiring plans.\n\u201cCompanies are definitely indicating a deferment in hiring plans for some key positions and we are receiving such communications,\" said E. Balaji, chief executive officer of Chennai-based Ma Foi Management Consultants Ltd, a search firm.\nK. Raghavendra, vice-president and head, human resources, Infosys BPO Ltd, said the company is likely to add fewer people in key roles in 2009.\nThe survey also showed that companies are planning to go easy on increments next year. Around 83% of the companies surveyed said salary increases in 2009 are likely to be lower than those originally planned. Around 19% of respondents said that they were likely to consider freezing 2009 salaries at 2008 levels.\nSanjay Jog, chief people officer, Future Group, said salary hikes in 2009 would be minimal for his group\u2019s employees. \u201cWe will only take a call in March, three months before our increments happen in the beginning of our financial year, July.\"\n\u201cAverage salary increments in 2009 are expected to hover around 8-10% against an average pay hike of 15-20% in 2007,\" added Balaji.\nAlmost half the Indian companies surveyed said they expected bonus payouts in 2009, for performance in 2008 to be lower than budgeted or planned.",

A lot of people assume that everyone experiences the world in the same way, but you have realized that we may actually all be a little different.\nWe actually have different abilities to taste things. In order for us to taste, we have to have receptors on our tongues to pick up certain flavors. Then nerves carry messages to our brains to tell us that we have tasted something. All flavors are combinations of salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and meaty (also called umami, which is pronounced like oo mommy). Our noses also have receptors, and this adds a lot to what we taste. Some people have genes to detect bitterness that other people dont. This may be why some people dont like brussel sprouts, broccoli, or other vegetables in that family. I like these vegetables, but I dont have that extra bitterness receptor.\nPandas are vegetarians and no longer have the genetic code for making umami receptors that work. A black bear that couldnt taste meat might leave fewer offspring than one that did, but theres no selection against pandas that cant taste meat, so the bad copies are harmless and stayed in their gene pool.\nThere are also a lot of psychological reasons why we like what we do. Maybe your favorite relative makes a food that will always be special to you because you love that person. Maybe you ate something when you had the stomach flu and you hate it now. What we like also depends on the culture in which were raised, what we have eaten in the past, and maybe even by advertising.\nThere is no way to know this, since we can't get \"inside\" another person's mind. That said, some people can taste certain chemicals that other people cannot, so we know to that extent that peoples' experiences are different.",

I was immediately awestruck at the way that Adonin uses his pieces to allow the viewer to see what they want to see. His images take on a life of their own from what he is able to envision, and the results are nothing short of extraordinary.\nFrom Jersusalem, Israel, Adonin uses his incredible painting talents to captivate the eyes of anyone who views his work. His art is truly mesmerizing through every oil paint stroke on canvas he makes. The varying hues and undertones present in his pieces makes it easy to stare at for a rather long time. With nothing too vibrant or too soft, his palette conveys the perfect color scheme in his pieces. Each color works together to make something so intricately beautiful and unique.\nFrom what I've seen in his work, Adonin creates an escape from reality in his abstract techniques. I can't help but create stories in my mind and imagine different things from what Adonin is able to bring to life.\nTo learn more about Adonin and to see more of his striking work, visit http://www.saatchiart.com/adonin.",

        "instruction": "Can you summarize the message of the first reading from Zephaniah and how it can be used as a personal message from God during meditation?: Today we have heard a couple of delightfully uplifting readings. The first reading from Zephaniah can be used in meditation as a personal message from the Lord. It's positive and encouraging and reassuring, not only because it promises victory over our troubles, but also because it says that God himself sings joyfully about each of us!\nHow does God sing joyfully? He sings joyfully when we persist through our difficulties, when we rely on his help to reach the kind of victory that only his Son provides through his resurrection. He finds joy when we find solutions through him and not through our reliance and focus on ourselves, a focus that separates us from him and others.\nWhen we pray, in our mind\u2019s eye, do we see Jesus as full of joy? Or do we picture him as somber or stern? Do we see him as affirming our goodness or denouncing our shortcomings?\nJoy is central to our faith and one of God's main attributes. It's one of the fruits of living in the will of God, a blessing from the Holy Spirit. It allows us to sing with Isaiah in today's responsorial: \"My strength and my courage is the Lord\u201d, a similar sentiment to the more widely known verse in Psalms 28, \u201cThe joy of the Lord is our strength.\u201d We draw strength from the victory Jesus won for us through his resurrection.\nSo often, when God invites us to be closer to him, when he invites us to share in the joy of his resurrection, we miss the signal. We can easily let the weight of the world, our sin, or the rejections we have experienced in the past, get to us. We can get angry or upset and find ourselves obsessing over the real or imagined problems that we face.\nTaking joy in the resurrection means we turn our eyes away from those things and look intently at the realities God wants us to focus on. It does us no good to get bogged down with fear over the problems that come our way. Instead, our Lord is calling us to address our problems through the lens of faith. He is calling us to look to His victory!\nWith the Blessed Mother, whose Feast of the Visitation we celebrate today, we can sing her song from the Gospel: \"My soul proclaims the greatness of the Lord; my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, for he has looked with favor on his lowly servant...the Almighty has done great things for me, and holy is his Name.\"\nNo matter how bad things seem, no matter how bleak or disastrous our trials appear to be, God does look with favor upon us, simply because he knows our desire to handle our challenges the Christian way, even though we may turn our back on him at times. \"He has mercy on those who fear him\u201d as Mary said, \u201cHe has shown the strength of his arm\"\nLooking at his victory is liberating and produces an incredible faith in our lives. And that faith in the Risen Lord will generate the wonderful joy that God wants us to have.\nLet us reflect today upon our own reactions to the reality of the Resurrection. Let\u2019s spend some time today gazing (in our mind\u2019s eye) upon his wonderful face. Jesus invites us to a deeper relationship with him today. With our eyes fixed on Him, all else that tempts us to feel discouragement will likely fade from focus.\nAnd so we pray, Lord, we do want to place our gaze upon you. We want to see your glory manifested in our lives. Help us to trust you in our most painful and frightening moments, knowing that your grace will sustain us through them all, and deliver to us the victory and the joy that you want for each of us!",

Who really uses this directory to find services anymore? Maybe someone needs to tell that to the hundreds of law firms that are still throwing their money away.\nOpen up just about any Yellow Pages book and you will see a substantial \u201clawyer\u201d section. There are pages and pages of ads. Some ads are in color, while others are not. There are big ads, medium ads and small ads. But you know what? Despite the attempts these law firms have made to make their ads stand out by adding color or buying more space, they are all pretty much the same. Close your eyes and randomly point to an ad, because it won\u2019t make any difference. It will have similar ad copy to all the others.\nCould Yellow Pages Advertising Become Extinct?\nFor more information, contact one of our attorney Web marketing experts today at 888.886.0939.

Data may vary with the various quality of FFPE samples.\nThe nCounter\u00ae Vantage 3D DNA SNV Assays leverage NanoString\u2019s proven molecular barcode technology. Each SNV panel is designed to detect the mutant allele of interest and a reference allele using a set of probes with novel architecture. The upstream probe (Probe S) has proprietary sequences that become unstable in the presence of a single nucleotide mismatch. The downstream probe (Probe T) is based on existing NanoString probe chemistry. Pools of Probe S and T are combined with an nCounter\u00ae molecular barcode SNV TagSet to enable highly specific detection of SNVs in a background of abundant normal tissue alleles.\nIntegration with the nSolver\u2122 Analysis Software provides a comprehensive detection solution from sample to data. Due to digital barcode chemistry, variants are detected at 1\u201310% levels.\nIn the data shown, all assayed variants are detected with >95% confidence (p<0.05 confidence threshold indicated by the dashed pink line).\nIn collaboration with a team from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Research Center, 5 ng of purified genomic DNA from over 40 different FFPE clinical research samples from a variety of cancer types were assayed with the nCounter\u00ae SNV detection chemistry. DNA integrity scores (DIN from TapeStation 2200 analysis) ranged from 2.3 to 6.1 for these samples. Somatic variants that had been previously detected by next-generation sequencing were detected with 98.1% sensitivity, 100.0% specificity, and 99.9% accuracy. Representative results for a selection of these samples are shown in Table 1.

But he is hopeful the hearing will sway a couple of Democrats as at least one whistleblower comes forward to testify.\nDuring the budget hearing, Shiomoto requested the committee provide $26 million in additional funds for the DMV to hire 400 additional employees.\n\u201cWe would like to have the ability to have $26 million available as we continue to ramp up and see increasing customers coming,\u201d Shiomoto said.\nHer request was met with initial skepticism, as lawmakers from both parties said they\u2019d like to see a formal proposal before reaching any decisions.\nShiomoto also said the DMV expects wait times to start dropping by mid-September and return to a more reasonable level by the end of the year.\nShe set goals of 15-minute wait times for people with appointments and 45-minute delays for those without appointments. Questions remain as to how feasible those targets will be.\nCullen Grant, a whistleblower set to testify during Wednesday\u2019s audit hearing, said more employees won\u2019t solve the underlying problem contributing to increased wait times. Grant has worked at the DMV for 13 years, including the past seven as an office manager in Los Angeles. He said outdated technology is to blame, citing a decades-old management system.\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing all this mass hiring, but it\u2019s not fixing the problem,\u201d Grant said.\nEight members will need to support an audit request in order for it to be referred to the state auditor, which will be a challenge considering only five Republicans are on the committee. Since Wednesday\u2019s hearing takes place in a joint committee, additional rules hurt Patterson\u2019s chances. It needs support from four Assembly members and four senators. Because there is one vacancy in the Senate, four of the six members will have to support it.\nDrivers are fed up with the DMV. So are California lawmakers.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Can you paraphrase the statement made by whistleblower Cullen Grant about the root cause of increased wait times at the DMV?",

Eight years later, in 2012, the doors to the second Pita Gourmet opened on the corner of Transit and Wehrle in Williamsville, with a capacity of about 50 people and typical lines out the door during lunch. Thanks to the creativity, passion, and tenacity of the Mahfouz family, Pita Gourmet opened the doors to their third location just this month! Members of the Manzella team attended the opening and had a great time enjoying the food and getting to know the family of this locally owned business. By expanding their footprint and being able to accommodate over 90 people, the new Pita Gourmet boasts an impressive atmosphere that showcases their patented Mediterranean fast casual dining experience. The space was designed by Bevilacqua Development and features the Buffalo skyline as well as 3D figures climbing up the wall to reinforce their \u201cKeep on Climbing\u201d philosophy. With almost 400 reviews and 4.5 stars on Google, they seem to be well received in the Buffalo area. The key to Pita Gourmet\u2019s success is the fusion of Mediterranean style foods the Mahfouz family grew up on with a mix of Buffalo classics. With four types of customizable salads, eight different pitas and wraps, and countless toppings, homemade dressings, and sauces\u2014you can tailor your lunch or dinner to fit any dietary preference. \u201cNot Fast Food, but Great Food Served Fast\u201d is the dining model Pita Gourmet has leveraged into a successful enterprise by combining the elements of quick and customizable ordering with health-conscious offerings. During the busiest time of the day at the Transit and Wehrle location in Clarence, you can get in and out with your made-to-order lunch in less than 10 minutes! If you\u2019re really in a pinch and need to order lunch or dinner quick, the new East Amherst location offers online ordering! Or if you are in the mood for something with a local flavor try the Buffalo chicken wrap with homemade buffalo sauce, chicken, lettuce, tomato, and onions. Pita Gourmet reached out to Manzella Marketing in February of 2019 and asked us to help take their business to the next level. Be sure to check out Pita Gourmet\u2019s social media accounts and enjoy the creativity and collaboration of Pita Gourmet and our Social Media Manager, Kristin Rozewski, Digital Specialist, Gabriel Buck, and Visual Communications Director, Eric Tuberdyke!

This is why, at the UN Climate Conference in Paris this month, world leaders sought to reach a new international agreement on climate change, essentially to keep global warming below 2\u00b0C (or 3.6\u00b0F). Rising temperatures pose threats on food and water security, infrastructure, ecosystems and health and, as a previous blog on this site shows, increases the risk of conflict. With an upsurge in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and the potential for rapid sea level rise, both mitigating human-related exacerbation of climate change, and adapting to its devastating effects are key priorities. This is where education comes in.\nBoth mitigation and adaptation require technological, institutional and behavioral responses. Correspondingly, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted the value of a mix of strategies to protect the planet, which combine policies with incentive-based approaches encompassing all actors from the individual citizen, to national governments and international communities. Because, while national and sub-national climate action plans are fundamental, changing individual behaviour also lies at the heart of responses to climate change.\nAt the individual level, barriers to the adoption of mitigation and adaptation measures include a lack of awareness and understanding of climate change risk, doubt about efficacy of one\u2019s action, lack of knowledge on how to change behavior and lack of financial resources to implement changes. Accordingly, there are many sound reasons to assume that different education strategies can help overcome these barriers both in direct and indirect manners.\nResponding to the challenges of climate change is going to require action on multiple fronts. Ignoring the impacts of education on climate change is no longer an option. Promoting universal secondary education should be given a high priority on the agenda as we look forward past last week\u2019s Paris meeting.",

I always find that I need a double batch during the holidays, once I know a recipe is good. I grab a bunch of freezer safe containers, save half for when company comes and give away half for tasting.\nThe trick for perfect sugar cookie decorations is the royal icing, not pictured below. We attempted to make the perfect icing but our measurements were a little off, resulting in some messy cookies. I\u2019ve since found a much better recipe for the icing and shared it below.\nCombine butter, sugar and powdered sugar until smooth.\nBeat in eggs and vanilla until combined.\nIn a separate bowl combine baking powder, salt and flour.\nAdd dry ingredients to wet, mix until well combined.\nRoll out dough, it works best on a baking mat, until it is 1/4 inch thick (or desired thickness).\nUsing a cookie cutter, cut into desired shapes and transfer to parchment paper lined cookie sheet.\nBake for 8-10 minutes, cool before adding icing.",

        "instruction": "For years, America has been in an affordable housing crisis. With home prices rising, more Americans are either moving in with family members or trapped in an expensive renting cycle. Those who can afford to own their own home often settle for smaller, more expensive homes that are sometimes farther away from work.\nIn 2016, the U.S. Census Bureau reported that the rate of U.S. home ownership declined by 62.9% - which is the sharpest reported decline since the figure first started tracking in 1965. And renters don\u2019t fare any better. According to a report from Harvard\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies in 2013, nearly half of all renters can\u2019t afford their rent.\nThe nuts and bolts of the affordable housing issue are complex, though many economists will say it comes down to high demand for homes with low supply. Construction rates cannot keep up with the need, and there are not enough laws that provide pricing protection for low- and middle-income Americans.\nThis is where manufactured homes come in as the most viable solution. Manufactured homes are constructed more efficiently, more affordably, and far more quickly than their stick-built counterparts. This alone should make manufactured housing an easy answer to the short supply of livable homes in America.\nAnd yet, despite that fact that these affordable housing solutions are structurally safe, attractive and produced with all of the same materials as stick-built homes, manufactured housing still faces an unjustified stigma in America. The truth is, common myths about manufactured housing just don\u2019t hold up against the elegance and integrity of their modern designs.\nSo, how exactly are these homes the answer to such a pervasive and long-held problem in America? Let\u2019s explore.\nManufactured homes are constructed quickly.\nPrefabricated homes differ from site-built homes due to the way they are constructed. Manufactured homes are constructed in off-site, climate-controlled factories, through processes that have been refined and streamlined.\nNot only does this allow for construction to continue independently of unexpected weather events, it also requires less labor, less time, and less energy use.\nAll said and done, a prefabricated home can be built and ready to ship in just weeks, with simpler designs taking only days. By comparison, homes constructed on-site can take anywhere from three to nine months, and that\u2019s without significant interruptions. Manufactured housing\u2019s quick and efficient build process goes a long way in ensuring the supply is there to meet the demand for affordable homes.\nManufactured homes are constructed with less upfront cost.\nIt\u2019s well understood that on-site construction activities can be costly, wasteful, and inefficient. Building homes in factories circumvents these problems by reducing wasted materials and making efficient use of machinery to use the minimal amount of energy and manpower.\nManufactured home factories purchase materials in bulk. The materials can then be stored indoors, protected from the elements until they are used. And since they order the exact sized materials every time, there\u2019s almost never any waste. In the event that there are any excess materials, those too can be saved and repurposed for custom home builds.\nLabor costs are also lower compared to site-built homes, due to the fact that manufactured homes take much less time to create.\nAll of these factors mean lower upfront building costs, which ultimately translate to large savings for the homebuyer. According to the Manufactured Housing Institute\u2019s 2018 Industry Overview, manufactured homes cost $58/square foot less than the average site built home.\nManufactured homes are affordable and quickly available.\nDue to the cost-saving and efficient building process, manufactured homes can be constructed with all of the same quality materials as site-built homes, and still be sold at a fraction of the cost.\nThis means that the large majority of homes in America that are affordable to low- and middle-income Americans are manufactured homes. Yet, while the volume of manufactured homes produced has increased year over year for the last decade, they still only house less than 10% of the United States population.\nFortunately, this can change quickly. Because of the ability for quick construction, custom-built manufactured homes can be available to the consumer in as little as six weeks. As long as there is available land, there can be available homes.\nLet\u2019s not forget also that the affordability of a home extends beyond its sticker price. Whether you are renting or buying, there are other factors that contribute to the overall cost of living. The hidden savings of manufactured homes lie in their efficiency. Many modern manufactured homes come Energy Star certified. This means they come with highly effective insulation, tightly constructed ducts and advanced window coatings to lower heating and cooling costs. The homes also come with Energy Star certified kitchen and bathroom appliances to lower electricity usage.\nAll in all, there is a tremendous solution to the affordable housing crisis in manufactured housing as more people embrace the safety, beauty and livability of these affordable homes.\nCommunity living makes manufactured homes even more affordable.\nManufactured homes still need a place to live, and the cost of land in many metropolitan areas can be quite high. Land-lease communities exist as a solution to this problem. Within communities like UMH\u2019s manufactured home communities, people can own their home as an asset while renting the land it lives on.\nThis makes homeownership even more accessible. Individuals purchasing homes in land-lease communities don\u2019t have to pay for land, and they don\u2019t have to pay to place the home. UMH\u2019s team lends their expertise and can place the home more quickly and more efficiently.\nAnd for those who do not have a down payment or who have no interest in purchasing a home, many UMH manufactured home communities offer affordable rental units.\nTo find out more about UMH\u2019s manufactured home communities, or to find a community near you, check out our community finder tool and start planning your journey to homeownership, today. Based on the passage above, Can you explain how land-lease communities make manufactured homes more affordable and accessible for low- to middle-income Americans?",

Some people claim to have seen them, some people claim to have never. The mythical beings of Iceland emerge as legends from a landscape that has historically been very unforgiving, where nothing less than constant work was necessary in order to survive. The tales of trolls, elves, ghosts and other monsters exist most likely as a way to explain the harsh elements, and give them some meaning.\nThis post offers a roundup of some of the most common mythical beings of Iceland, especially the ones that we encounter in the landscape every day.\nThe Hulduf\u00f3lk take the crown as the most well known mythical being of Iceland, partly because of the controversy relating to exactly how many Icelanders actually believe in elves. The internet is awash with reports that the majority of Icelanders believe in Elves, as this article and this article note.\nIn an effort to quantify this, a 2007 study form the University of Iceland shows that eight percent of Icelandic people believe that elves definitely exist, but 54 percent would not deny that elves exist. This is something like being elf-agnostic. Iceland is elf-agnostic.\nN]ear mirror-images of those humans who told stories about them\u2014except they were beautiful, powerful, alluring, and free from care, while the Icelanders were often starving and struggling for existence. The hulduf\u00f3lk seem in many ways to represent the Icelander's dreams of a more perfect and happy existence.\nIn the East of iceland, int he small town of Borgarfjordur Eystri there is the famous Elf Church which you can climb on top of! This is also an excellent hiking area, it feels a lot like the end of the world!\nTrolls are important mythical beings in Icleand. Trolls are everywhere and you don't have to look too far and wide to see them; you can actually see them in some of Iceland\u2019s most well-known natural highlights! Check out the pictures below and see what you can see!\nSometimes, the faces are really obvious, sometimes they are not. The famous sea stacks a of Reynisdrangar are said to be trolls, frozen forever by the sun when they tried to dragged a three-masted ship to land. This is what happens to trolls in sunlight. They petrify. What about the trolls that behave themselves? They are out there, somewhere.\nIt looks like the beautiful grey horse that you'll ever see. The situation changes quite rapidly once you sit on it, because as soon as you do, it will run into the nearest body of water and drown you! It hooves are backwards, so watch those hooves carefully!\nLast but not least, we have Iceland\u2019s very own version of Nessie, that is to say, the Loch Ness Monster. The Lagarflj\u00f3t Worm is said to be a serpentine-like creature that lives in Lagarflj\u00f3t, a freshwater, below-sea-level, glacial-fed lake which has very poor visibility as a result of siltation located int he East of Iceland.\nWhat is remarkable about the Worm is that there have been alleged sighting ever since the settlement period of Iceland, in the 14th century, all the way through to the the present day, and apparently even a video. We dug it up so you could see it for yourself. There is definitely something long in the water.\nThey are many, many more mythical beings in Iceland, this little list was meant to whet your appetite, but you\u2019ll have to come over here and visit this amazing land yourself your self to really understand where these legends come from! You might even catch the worm!",

This is about one of those places. What a moving piece of poetry. It reminds me a lot of the old English bard's \"I must go down to the sea again, to the lonely sea and sky, and all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer me by. \" Like this poem, Tina K's evokes sentiment and a yearning to reconnect to those little intangibles we hold so dear. Loved it - sparks much more than memories! I love this poem! It takes me back to me childhood. I read it a lot. Your poem touched my heart in a special way. When I was a young girl, our apple tree was my special place. When I was troubled, I would sit in its branches until I felt better. It was a place to go when I was happy too.I remember taking tomatoes from the garden and a salt shaker up to my favorite branch and just sat there and ate and comtemplated. I did the same thing when the green apples were big enough to eat, even though they were not ripe! Your poem took me back to a happier time,many, many years ago. To that lovely tree where I cried. And a serene cerulean sky. The tinder for memory's spark. And to make my peace with him. Can you continue the poem \"Tina K's\" with a personal experience of your own related to the place you left behind?",

Cooking is one of our passions and we especially like using the fresh ingredients from our garden.\nThis is a great salsa recipe that also makes a great summer salad too.\nA classic Italian appetizer. It is especially good with fresh herbs from the garden.\nThis recipe was shared with us from a Bed & Breakfast in Lancaster County Pennsylvania. It has become a family favorite and is always a part of our holiday breakfasts. It is a different take on traditional oatmeal.\nCreme fraiche is absolutely delicious on fresh strawberries. The sour cream that is added to a traditional whip cream stabilizes the cream so that it doesn't separate and get watery. This recipe can be made in smaller or larger quantities as needed. A great topping for strawberry pie!\nOne of our favorite salad dressings to use in the summer time. It is light and refreshing.\nA great summer salad that we never seem to get tired of. For those that are diabetic, I have substituted artificial sweetner for the sugar in this with great results. We give this salad a different twist on occasion by adding Craisins and nuts to it.\nThis recipe is one of my favorites that my Grandmother Bryan made for me in my childhood. My children now enjoy it just as much and it is requested for dinner often.\nThese meatballs are also great as an appetizer and can be kept warm in a crock pot for a potluck gathering. The barbeque sauce and peach preserves used in the sauce make a great contrast to the Cajun spice in the meatballs.\nAnother summer favorite of ours when we use the grill often.

With over 500 employees and a loan book exceeding \u00a32 billion, they\u2019re on track to become one of the most profitable and stable organisations in their region.\nFollowing a rebrand and name change, Together were struggling to achieve great Google rankings and visibility. They needed to boost their new brand and identity to get ahead of the pre-existing negative online reviews associated with the old brand.\nTheir SEO strategy wasn\u2019t delivering high volumes of traffic which was impacting their website\u2019s Domain Authority. In addition to this, their website\u2019s on-page content wasn\u2019t effectively targeting search terms used by prospective customers. This meant that they were failing to capitalise on organic traffic.\nOur initial audit for Together\u2019s digital presence led to our strategy to deliver high volumes of quality traffic that would convert through campaign specific goals. The first step for the Kagool team was to carry out a design refresh to create a new identity. Our approach then focussed on introducing PPC, drastically improving organic search results and optimising on-page content.\nAfter identifying the huge benefits of PPC that were being missed, we developed targeted campaigns to help Together reach their objectives at a low cost.\nThey started ranking for non-brand terms, relating to products. Nobody knew who Together were so we also had to start driving awareness of the brand.\nIn a short space of time we were able to see Together\u2019s Google rankings improve. We successfully increased their online visibility, which could be seen in the 75% increase in new website visitors and 72% growth of organic traffic. Together Money started ranking for non-brand terms that related to products which also contributed to driving brand awareness.\nMoving forward Together are looking to focus on improving user experience on site by implementing testimonials and reviews and utilising Sitecore\u2019s personalisation tool.

Given material: REPORTER FILE PHOTO | The president of the Gift of Life Foundation thanks the community. On behalf of the board of directors of the Island Gift Of Life, I would like to extend our thanks to the community for their overwhelming support of the Cheryl Hannabury Memorial Community Cocktail party held a the Ram\u2019s Head Inn Saturday, March 2. In addition, my thanks goes out to all of the volunteers, contributors and underwriters that helped to make this event possible. This is one of two events, the other being the Beach Blast, (of late afflicted with bad weather), that the Foundation depends on to fund it\u2019s efforts to aid those with life threatening illness as well as to increase the bone marrow donor registry. The Gift Of Life was the inspiration of Cheryl Hannabury and is her legacy. At the outset, we on the board actually worried that \u201cbusiness\u201d was not good, people didn\u2019t seem to need us, but as the years rolled on \u2014 this is our 14th \u2014 we developed traction. Through doctors, clergy, social workers, and just plain word of mouth coupled with hard economic times, our \u201cbusiness\u201d is booming. This is certainly a mixed blessing and great challenge, but one we are endeavoring to meet. Our service area includes the four towns east of Riverhead, though we in some way try to help anyone who contacts us. At this moment we have fourteen active cases. It is clear that despite successful events such as the recent Ram\u2019s Head Inn party, soon the volume of cases may outstrip our ability to raise these life giving funds. It is our hope that you will continue to keep the Gift Of Life in your hearts throughout the year. Not only through monetary donation, though this is always welcome, but by helping to spread the word not only to those in need and to others who may be able to help the Foundation continue it\u2019s mission. We are also always in need of new volunteers whether as board members or on one of our committees. Please feel free to contact us at any time for any reason. We are a 501-(c 3) corporation and may be reached through our website at islandgiftoflife.org or by contacting any board member directly. Again, thank you all for helping to make this month\u2019s event truly a great party. ELEANOR P. LABROZZI PHOTOS | Auctioneer Ken Lewis (right) at the Gift of Life Foundation's 12th annual fundraiser Saturday at the Ram's Head Inn. A big turnout made for a successful night for the Gift of Life Foundation Saturday when it held its 12th annual fundraising cocktail party and auction at the Ram\u2019s Head Inn. Started in memory of Cheryl Hannabury, an Islander from a long line of Islanders, the Foundation raises money to assist East Enders who are suffering from life-threatening diseases. Ms. Hannabury died after a battle with non-Hodgkins lymphoma. Her mother Charlotte was among those at Saturday\u2019s event. For more details, see the March 8 edition of the Reporter.",

In the new season of Chopped Grill Masters, debuting July 31, four Texas favorites will duke it out with chefs from Kansas City, Missouri; North Carolina; and Memphis, Tennessee, for bragging rights \u2014 and a $50,000 grand prize.\nWhere previous editions of the spin-off series have matched up contestants regardless of geography, this season introduces a new twist by pitting each of the state\u2019s contestants against each other to determine the best of the best. Once the winner of each heat is decided, they will compete against the other on the August 28 finale for the final fat check.\nThe Texas episode, airing on August 21, features four Texas pitmasters. Carlo Casonova of KG Cookers BBQ, a competition barbecue team and catering company, joins Esaul Ramos of the acclaimed 2M Smokehouse in an attempt to bring glory home to San Antonio. They\u2019ll be jumping into the fire with Leonard Botello, owner of Brenham\u2019s Truth BBQ, and Sloan Rinaldi of Kingwood\u2019s all-woman pop-up barbecue company, The Q Joint.\nAs in the main series, each chef will battle in three timed rounds to create an appetizer, entree, and dessert. The hectic pace of the show may prove to be a breaking point for some of the pitmasters. Unlike the show\u2019s usual competitors, many of this year\u2019s contestants come from the barbecue competition circuit and are used to a much more leisurely pace of cooking than the Chopped kitchen allows.\nAnd, of course, there is the challenge of the mystery basket. The Food Network teases that the Texas pitmasters will be blessed with an \u201ciconic Texas meat\u201d in the second round, but they will have to think far outside of brisket. The first round\u2019s basket will include a \u201ccreepy, crawly, crunchy surprise\u201d and the second will force the contestants to incorporate a \"state fair treat.\"\nThe series saved the best for last, so you\u2019ll have to wait a few episodes to cheer on the hometown heroes. The Texas episode debuts at 8 pm on August 21, the week before the finale.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: When does the Texas episode of Chopped Grill Masters air, and who are the four Texas pitmasters competing in it?",

Jessica writes the New York Times column, \"The Parent-Teacher Conference,\" is a correspondent at The Atlantic and a regular commentator on Vermont Public Radio, and formerly taught middle and high school English and Latin. She has appeared as a parenting and education expert on The Today Show, Fox and Friends, MSNBC, the BBC, NPR, and many others.\nHer book, The Gift of Failure: Why Parents Need to Learn to Let Go So Their Children Can Succeed, is full of profoundly valuable advice for parents and for educators. In her introduction to the book, Lahey writes, \"Out of love and desire to protect our children's self-esteem, we have bulldozed every uncomfortable bump and obstacle out of their way, clearing the manicured path we hoped would lead to success and happiness. Unfortunately, in doing so we have deprived our children of the most important lessons of childhood. The setbacks, mistakes, miscalculations, and failures we have shoved out of our children's way are the very experiences that teach them how to be resourceful, persistent, innovative, and resilient citizens of the world.\" This message fits closely with Mason Prep's mission, especially as we strive to develop our students' self-discipline, responsibility, and accountability and to help them to become productive citizens of a global community. Although we work very hard at Mason Prep to help our students succeed, we also believe it is very important to help them deal with situations in which they are not successful.\n\u2022 Make sure your child understands that mistakes and failures do not impact the love you have for him or her.\nThe wisdom found in The Gift of Failure is too profound to be distilled into one blog post. I encourage all parents to read this book and to follow Jessica Lahey on social media (Twitter/Facebook). We all have the same desire: to raise children who will become successful, responsible adults. Lahey\u2019s writings provide great guideposts along the way.\nHow does Lahey suggest that parents should approach their children's mistakes and failures in order to help them become resilient citizens of the world?",

It will work similarly to the GIF button in Facebook Messenger, allowing users to both browse trending GIFs and search for specific reactions in-line. Users still won\u2019t have the ability to select and share GIFs as News Feed posts, but comment GIFs could lay the groundwork for that.\nFacebook has long shirked the animated image medium. The rationale was that allowing flashy, eye-catching GIFs might distract from the rest of the News Feed experience. Facebook has even reportedly had support for GIFs built for years, but delayed rolling it out for fear of disrupting the feed aesthetic.\nThat was before Facebook News Feeds filled up with auto-play video. Eventually Facebook permitted News Feed sharing with the direct URL of a GIF file, but that meant users had to search for them on sites like Imgur or Tumblr, or host them themselves. Then Facebook only allowed Pages and ads to share GIFs. There was still no GIF browser and no uploading by users allowed.\nAnd all the while, Facebook\u2019s feed downranked \u201clow-quality memes,\u201d which could include \u2018image macros\u2019 made up of a GIF + overlaid text. Messenger added GIF sharing back in 2015, but the main Facebook app still didn\u2019t play nice with the format.\nThis anti-GIF orthodoxy eventually began to hold Facebook back. Fellow content-browsing site Imgur has ridden GIF sharing to 150 million users, and BuzzFeed\u2019s GIF listicles have been some of the most popular links leading people away from Facebook.\nBut now Facebook is diving headfirst into visual communication, following Snapchat\u2019s lead as social media usage evolves from text statuses to rich media. Most of that focus has been on video. However, Facebook sees flexibility as crucial to keeping users from straying to other broadcast channels.\nIf the test is well received, Facebook comment reels might soon be filled with \u2018reaction GIFs\u2019. These typically use a clip of a movie, television show, or cartoon to express the emotion of the user, from excitement to concern.\nAnd eventually, Facebook might loosen up and add a GIF button to the News Feed composer. After all, GIFs are just the best moments of video played on loop, and Facebook says video is its future.",

Much needed words today - thank you!\nThe poem - speaks so much to me today as a friend just lost a family member to a gunshot. Other bullets penetrate our hearts as well. A needed reminder to forgive, even in the little.\nyes, if small acts of forgiveness don't vanquish the small resentments caused by \"little niggling offences\", those resentments accumulate. conversely, small acts of forgiveness accumulate in a positive way, helping us to be persons whose default is forgiveness instead of resentment. i think \"micro-forgiveness\" is a especially salutary spiritual discipline, because it is conducive to humility (when we are forgiving small things, rather than big ones, there's less danger of our congratulating ourselves on how virtuous (in particular, how forgiving) we are).\nthanks for the poem and the gloss!\nSuch good and wise words.\n@chris Thank you for the \"micro-forgiveness\" term and the hopeful idea that small acts of forgiveness can build on each other. \"Persons whose default is forgiveness\" - I want to be one of those! I recognize in myself the tendency to self-congratulation when all I've done is obey (and imperfectly at that), so it is certainly possible that forgiving small things offers some protection against that bent.\nThank you for your prayers, not just for me but also for other commenters. God has been kind to me in the readers He has brought here.\nOuch. The friendly fire hits home. So thankful that forgiveness is always available for us to give. I pray I will take more advantage of it.\nThis makes me think of a conversation with my youngest yesterday. She was saying how much she loves playing pretend because you can always start over compared to real life where you can't. Then she added, \"Unless you accept Jesus, then you can start over. Except for the words you've said. They're still out there.\"\nAppreciated your poem and thoughts--and the conversation they then welcomed in my mind. I woke up thinking about forgiveness and how it is essential if wanting to welcome love. Gee, wish we could just talk about all of this over a large glass of iced tea!\nSo beautiful! Fathoms of depth. Godliness.\nYou are so very right--it ALL must be redeemed. Those little seeds of impurity sprout a harvest of cynicism and bitterness when left to seed and reseed themselves.\nThe poem at the beginning - it reminded me of where I was over 20 years ago - realzing that I didn't have to fight to protect myself anymore with words - I gave that battle to God - Peace from the battle - God gave that to me! And, in that peace, I found the ability to forgive:) Your post so touched my heart - reminding me of just how thankful I am that our Father is a loving Father!\n@Lisa notes... Ouch- I know! Writing about forgiveness is easier than practicing it (though not nearly so beneficial). I'm thankful it's always available to receive, too. :) God bless you, friend.\nP.S. Are you going to read the Stott book with the challies.com crowd?\nWhat a great image of seeds of impurity propagating! Thanks so much for that.\nHappy homeschooling. I'm sending you a virtual bouquet of sharp #2 pencils.\nMmm hmmm. I find it especially hard to forgive when forgiveness hasn't been sought.\n@Brandee Shafer I know, I know. But you know what else? The Lord Jesus prayed from the cross, forgiving those who had not sought it and didn't even know what they were doing so horribly wrong. If it's true, and I believe it is, that His Spirit dwells in us believers, He can do it again when we need to forgive those who haven't sought it.",

We are talking about Wendy\u2019s Lookbook. Her timeless style is the epitome of elegance and femininity of women, but she also knows how to give a fresh and youthful looks to all. She loves volume skirts and waist cuts, stilettos, dresses, and all those clothes that make us feel feminine. As you will see it is also a great lover of mixing textures, patterns and colors. I also like that it always gives us a similar but cheaper option to shoes and bags of their looks. But what impressed me most about her, is that after her delicate appearance, you can find a woman with personality and willpower. We just have to read what she says on her blog (here). Now we see a stylish woman with a closet full of clothes unattainable for most of us, traveling from one place to another and a with life that many people envy. But her beginnings were very different. Since she was a kid she went from one foster care throught another, carrying all their belongings in a trash bag and being worried about homeless with the age 18 years. Despite growing up in such an unfavorable situation and live her childhood within a dysfunctional family, after the school hours she managed to work with the intention of saving up to go to college. She finished high school with honors, getting some scholarships that allowed her to emancipate from foster homes, and enroll in Beckerley University where he majored in Psychology some years later. That\u2019s nothing. While at the University and once graduated, continued caring for the young people who like her, have grown in unfavorable situations and dysfunctional families, working as a social educator in several centers. Her intention is to teach these young, that there is another life beyond the life they know, and that they can also study and grow their own future out of jail, drugs and fights. How often we tend to brand the fashion world, to people that have to do with him and everything around him, of superficial. While it is true that in many cases it is, you can never get everyone in the same bag. So without know Wendy personally, I know that she is a person with a unique values ??and a unique strength. It is not easy to do the right thing when everything around you pushes you to go astray and I know that people like her are made of a paste than the rest of us aren\u2019t and I feel very fortunate to have someone close to me that has experienced something similar, and that nevertheless worked his future as Wendy made. Having this person close to me, teaches me of how to be better every day, to value things and above all not to judge people by what they have, if not for what they are. If you like to know Wendy more closely she also has a Youtube channel with very useful tutorials where you can see how nice she is (here)! I hope you enjoy this post now I leave you with some of her wonderful looks!\nShare the post \"Style and history of Wendy Nguyen\"\nPara mi tambi\u00e9n es una de mis bloggers favoritas, pero adem\u00e1s cuando le\u00ed su historia me gusto m\u00e1s a\u00fan.\nLa verdad,hay veces que ves a algunas bloggers y piensas jolin esta chica naci\u00f3 con unos patucos Dior ,y eso me parece que no es tener estilo,quizas si lo tenga pero si todas tuvi\u00e9ramos su nivel econ\u00f3mico ir\u00edamos igualmente como princesas.

A booming niche, meal kits cater to customers looking for a compromise between quality home-cooked meals and out-to-eat convenience.\nBefore putting them in stores nationwide, Kroger will spend the rest of 2018 learning how much appetite customers have for Home Chef meals that require even less prep time with a new line called Home Chef Express, which can be finished at home in about 15 minutes instead of 30 to 60 minutes.\nThe meal kits cost between $17 to $20 each and serve two people. Kroger's plan is the first move it's taken since acquiring Chicago-based Home Chef.\nHome Chef meals are available in 25 Wisconsin stores, mostly in the Milwaukee metro area, said James Hyland, a company spokesman. Kroger operates the Pick 'n Save, Metro Market and Copps banners in Wisconsin.\nThe company expects to add the meal kits in 15 additional Wisconsin stores by early November, Hyland said. The meal kits are also available in 31 Kroger-owned stores in Illinois.\nKroger is test marketing Home Chef Express meals in Kentucky and Michigan. Kroger will test both concepts side by side in Cincinnati.\nKroger expects to make Home Chef meal kits available in stores nationwide in early 2019.

When asked \u2018where have you had to change your child?\u2019 1,291 (57%) said on the floor of a public toilet and 1,000 (43%) said on the ground outside. In all, 97% of respondents said changing their child when out and about was a problem and 45% stated it was their biggest problem.\nParents shared experiences of having to change their child in public places including the floor of an airport, a corner of a restaurant, abandoning a day trip and even having to leave their child in a soiled nappy due to lack of facilities.\nThe survey also had clear indications about what additions to changing facilities would make parents\u2019 life easier: 96% wanted a height adjustable changing bench, 95% said simply a private area and 59% called for a mobile hoist.\nSmyth said that the time had come to have better facilities for disabled children. \u201cThere are so many of us who don\u2019t like putting our handbags on the floor of a public toilet yet for parents of children with disabilities, sometimes we\u2019ve been left with no other option but to change our children on public toilet floors,\u201d she said.\n\u201cThis is a very telling survey and we fear that there are many venues, businesses, shopping centres, restaurants and visitor attractions that need to be better equipped for children with special needs. As a parent of a child with special needs, I know what a difference good facilities make. One of things we desire most for our children and families is a sense of normality \u2013 being able to do things and go places without the worry of adequate facilities. I\u2019ve lost count of the times we\u2019ve had to abandon a day out because Daniel needed to be changed and there have been many occasions when a dirty public toilet floor was my only option.\nExisting campaign Changing Places has helped to drive up the number of accessible changing facilities in the UK in recent years \u2013 about 700 venues now have a Changing Places toilet \u2013 but thousands of toilets and venues still do not have such facilities.\nSpace to Change provides suggestions on how a venue can improve its facilities to better meet the needs of families who have children with special needs, in return they are awarded 1 of 3 Levels \u2013 green, orange or pink.\nTo learn more about the campaign, including how to become a Space to Change champion go to: www.firefly-garden.com. Based on the passage above, According to the survey conducted by Firefly Garden, what percentage of parents have had to change their child on the floor of a public toilet, and what improvements to changing facilities would make their lives easier?",

Answer according to: Number of Jobs in Manufacturing in the U.S.\nFederal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said that productivity is \u201cperhaps the single most important determinant of average living standards.\u201d Manufacturing productivity (excluding computers) consistently outpaces such growth in other sectors; between 1998 and 2011, it grew at an average annual rate of 3.3 percent. In contrast, service sector productivity grew by 1.5 percent. Higher productivity means that we can produce more with our stock of resources (labor and capital) and it is thus the basis for higher wages and living standards. Rising productivity is one reason prices of manufactured goods have risen at a slower rate than the overall price level.\nSustainable long-term economic growth is the result of increases in the size and quality of the labor force, investment in capital equipment, and technological improvements. The trend in the size of the labor force is largely determined by demographic factors and immigration. Investments in capital equipment, technology, and education, however, are sensitive to policy decisions. The manufacturing sector is the most intensive user of capital equipment and technology, which explains why it is the nation's productivity powerhouse. Continued growth in productivity requires an increasingly skilled labor force, something that can be addressed by policies directing more investment in education to provide students with the technical skills required in today's factories.",

        "instruction": "Given the text: If you have recently used bitcoin, then chances are that you have noticed that transaction times have become significantly slower. In fact, during the last couple of days over 40,000 transactions simply idled on the blockchain, without getting the needed confirmation to go through.\nThe actual cause behind this delay is not yet known, but there is speculation surrounding it. While those involved with the blocksize debate believe that a higher number of transactions has taken place, and that not all could be included in their afferent blocks, others think that it has something to do with the fees included for each trades, while another group of people believe that this is a result of a systematic attack on the blockchain network.\nHowever, the right answer may have to do something with the transactions fees. To put things better into perspective, once a transaction is submitted, it is placed in a queue, at the end of which, it goes through, after receiving all afferent confirmations. However, if a transaction with a higher fee is made later, it gets priority, and goes through before the other one. This works as a way of encouraging bitcoin users to include bigger fees, in order to support miners and the blockchain network. While technically, transactions with a fee equal to 0 can be sent whenever users wish to, there\u2019s no guarantee that the transactions will end up going through.\nDue to the so-called \u2018bitcoin traffic jam\u2019, many businesses were forced to stop accepting bitcoin for the time-being, or even switch up to various altcoins such as litecoin. Additionally, another major repercussion of this traffic jam is a drop of value in bitcoin\u2019s price. In fact, according to price trackers, the price fell from roughly $440 on Monday, to $400 at the time of writing. This yet again proves how sensible bitcoin can be to unexpected changes, and once again ensures that price volatility is still a thing.\nAs time passed, most of the transactions were either cancelled, with the funds being returned to the original users, or went through, with major delays. At this moment in time, there are still a couple of thousands transactions blocked on the blockchain, yet the issue will surely be resolved by the end of the weekend.\nCurrently, there are two possible ways to prevent such traffic jams from happening again in the future. One would be to increase the blocksize limit, as this will allow more than 7 transactions to go through per second, while the other idea would be to include higher transaction fees whenever you send money through the blockchain, to ensure priority over the others in the queue.\nBased on everything that has been outlined so far, have you been affected by this issue? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below.\nCan you provide more information on the potential causes of the recent slowdown in bitcoin transaction times, and the various theories surrounding it?",

The television series became a huge pop culture phenomenon in the mid 80s and you\u2019d be hard pressed to find a kid from that era that doesn\u2019t have a warm spot in their heart for the giant sword-wielding mechanical protector.\nThe \u2018Voltron\u2019 comic book series will be written by Dynamite\u2019s Brandon Thomas (\u2018Robin: The Big League\u2019) and feature a series of variant covers, including two by the incomparable Alex Ross (\u2018Kingdom Come\u2019), the man who won the Comic Buyer\u2019s Guide award for favorite painter award so many times that CBG had to retire it. The artwork, as expected is stunning. Fans of giant robots, adventure, anime, and just plain fun will have a lot to look forward to this December when \u2018Voltron\u2019 #1 hits newsstands.\nWhat is Dynamite Entertainment's track record in bringing retro pop culture icons into comic book form? Can you name some of the comic book series published by Dynamite?",

Consider you are measuring the mass of the top quark (why, I know you do it at least once a week, just to keep mentally fit). You could say you have no idea whatsoever of what the top mass is, but you are capable of guessing, and your best guess is that the top mass is twice the mass of the W boson: after all, you have read somewhere that the top quark decays into a W boson plus other stuff, so a good first-order estimate is 2x80.4= 160.8 GeV.\nSummary: How are blogs changing the way science news develops and is reported?

        "instruction": "Imagine a lake made entirely of red-hot lava. How about a cloud of searing hot rock and dust traveling more than 450 miles per hour above a volcano? These are some of the dramatic results of volcanic eruptions.\nVolcanoes come in many forms \u2013 rift volcanoes, which form in places where the Earth\u2019s plates have moved apart; hot spot volcanoes, where lava spews from a simple crack in the Earth; or stratovolcanoes, where thick lava flows slowly from a cone-shaped volcano.\nThe most dangerous volcanoes in the world are those that have been quiet for hundreds of years. People feel safe around these volcanoes and build homes and farms nearby. Then when a volcano becomes active again, disaster strikes.\nIn 1783, over 140 craters in the Laki rift in Iceland began erupting. The eruptions went on for 8 months, spewing lava and toxic gases. Over 9,350 people died from starvation or from poisoning \u2013 one quarter of Iceland\u2019s population at that time.\nThe summer of 1783 in Iceland was called the \u201csand-summer\u201d because of the ash fallout from the Laki rift eruption.\nThe lava flows very slowly from a stratovolcano and sometimes plugs the volcano. This is what happened in Krakatoa, Indonesia in 1883. The volcano actually exploded because of built up pressure, causing tsunamis and pyroclastic flows. 36,417 people died.\nThe Krakatoa eruption caused a huge explosion. The sound was reportedly heard from up to 3,000 miles away and is considered the loudest sound ever heard.\nIn June, 1991, Mount Pinatubo erupted and the top of the volcano blew off, spewing 2.4 cubic miles of ash and rock. The ash cloud and pyroclastic flows covered the landscape. A layer of sulfuric acid surrounded the entire Earth. 800 people were killed.\nJust before Mount Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines about 30,000 people evacuated to the Amoranto Velodrome, a sports complex, in Quezon City and others relocated to Manila as well. Can you imagine running from a mountain?\nThe explosion caused by the eruption of Tambora in Sumbawa, Indonesia, was the largest volcanic eruption ever recorded. People over 1,200 miles away heard it. Gas and ash from the volcano spread worldwide, clouding out the Sun. People called 1816 the \u201cyear without a summer.\u201d Crops couldn\u2019t grow, causing the worst famine in 100 years. 60,000 people perished.\nMount Tambora was reduced by 1/3 of its height by the eruption in 1816.\nProbably the most famous volcanic eruption of all time is Vesuvius, in Naples, Italy. The eruption occurred during the Roman Empire in 79 CE. Ash flows covered the Roman towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii, killing everyone in its path. The remains of Vesuvius have been excavated.\nMount Vesuvius is the only volcano to have erupted during the last one hundred years on the European mainland.\nPyroclastic flow: a flow of ash and hot rock that can rise over 2 miles in the air above a volcano at speeds up to 450 miles per hour. The flow is deadly in the moment and can cause long-term air pollution.\nTsunami: a fast, intense surge of water caused by plate movement beneath the ocean.\nQuestion: How hot is a pyroclastic flow?\nAnswer: A pyroclastic flow is typically 600 degrees Fahrenheit or more.

However, take a closer look and you will find that this innovation is merely novelty in disguise. Let\u2019s take for example, eBay,Uber, and many of today\u2019s content marketing analytics firms. eBay did not invent auctions; it simply brought a centuries-old method of trading to a convenient new medium. Uber did not create the idea of a Taxi service; it ingeniously brought organization to a mass of vehicles, drivers, and eager-to-pay customers. Lastly, content marketing analytics firms did not invent predictive analytics, but instead brought the common practice of applying analytics to a previously empirical industry. We call this an Imitative Innovation Strategy. Simplicity: the ultimate sophistication\u2026 that is especially true when considering content marketing analytics. The inputs of these analytics algorithms have to account for a multitude of possibilities. You want your analytics to be timely, relevant, and valuable to your industry\u2026 otherwise your marketing ROI will plummet like a raindrop from a cloud. Fortunately the brilliant minds at Google have developed Google Trends! This analytics engine does the work for you, and can serve as an extra input to disperse the variable weight of your predictive algorithm. Google Trends not only tracks today\u2019s relevancy of any search term, but it can be geo-targeted, compared with other search terms, and forecasted! If there is enough data available, you can determine which keywords will be valuable six months ahead of time so that you can adjust your blogging efforts today. Google Trends can be used to increase the accuracy of your predictive content analytics from third party services. More accurate analytics can be directly proportionate to your marketing ROI\u2026 so I would suggest starting your thank you letter to Google as soon as possible. Whether you conduct your content marketing analytics in house, through a third party, or don\u2019t currently utilize this type of information; Enfusen can help you determine where you\u2019re at, and help you get where you want to be.

This technical bulletin outlines recommended shrinkage testing mix matrixes, reviews pertinent sections of ASTM C157, \u201cStandard Test Method for Length Change of Hardened Hydraulic-Cement Mortar and Concrete,\u201d and details a suggested format for reporting laboratory shrinkage test results. The Technical Bulletin is relevant for ECLIPSE\u00ae 4500 and ECLIPSE\u00ae Floor 200.\nWater content, mortar paste fraction, admixture selection, cementitious and pozzolan types and quantities, coupled with aggregate characteristics and mix design proportions most significantly impact concrete\u2019s drying shrinkage characteristics. Careful selection of these variables are critical when designing and testing low shrinkage mixes.\nDrying shrinkage properties of ECLIPSE\u00ae admixed concrete is typically, but not always, linear from 1% to 2.5% by weight of cement ECLIPSE\u00ae dosage rates. Therefore, it is recommended concrete admixed with, at a minimum, low and high dosage rates of ECLIPSE\u00ae be included in the shrinkage test matrix.\nReference concrete containing no ECLIPSE\u00ae must be included in the test matrix. This is essential because ECLIPSE\u00ae admixed concrete shrinkage performance is measured relative to reference concrete shrinkage performance.\nIt is recommended both superplasticized and mid-range water reduced mixes be incorporated into the shrinkage test matrix, since these admixtures may optimize reductions in drying shrinkage.\nLab concrete shall be sampled in accordance with ASTM C192, while field concrete shall be sampled in accordance with ASTM C172. Plastic concrete tests including slump, air, unit weight and temperature shall be conducted and recorded for each concrete sample. Compressive strength testing shall be conducted at a minimum of 2 ages (including 28 days) and set time testing is also recommended.\nConcrete shall be placed in shrinkage molds in two approximately equal layers and consolidated by rodding, unless the slump is less than 76 mm (3 in.), at which time vibration shall be used. The concrete shall be carefully hand worked around each gage stud, followed by striking off with a straight edge. The steel plates holding the gage studs at the end of each mold should be loosened after consolidation.\nASTM C157 requires moist cabinet or moist room curing per ASTM C511 during the initial period. However, if the specimen top surfaces are covered with plastic or wet burlap, it should be acceptable to cure specimens in ambient conditions, since all of the specimen surface area will be covered, thereby not allowing moisture to migrate out. ASTM C157 test deviations should be noted in report.\nAt time 23 \u00b1 \u00bd hour, specimens are carefully demolded and placed in lime saturated water maintained at 23.0 \u00b1 1.7\u00b0C (73.4 \u00b1 3\u00b0F) for minimum 30 minutes. At time 24 \u00b1 \u00bd hour, initial comparator readings (called 1 day reading) are taken on wiped down specimens, which are then placed back in the lime saturated water tank.\nASTM C157 states \u201cAfter the initial comparator reading, store the specimens in lime saturated water at 23.0 \u00b1 1.7\u00b0C (73.4 \u00b1 3\u00b0F) until they have reached an age of 28 days, including the period in the molds, unless another condition or duration of curing is specified\u201d. THIS STATEMENT IMPLIES 28 DAY WET CURING IS NOT REQUIRED BY ASTM. GCP Applied Technologies recommends an additional 6 days of lime saturated water curing, which brings the specimen age to 7 days.\nNote: ASTM C494, \u201cStandard Specification for Chemical Admixtures for Concrete,\u201d Section 17.1.4 Length Change states \u201cTest specimens shall be tested in accordance with Test Method C157 except that the moist curing period, including the period in the molds, shall be 14 days\u201d. This statement reaffirms that a 28 day moist cure is not absolutely required.\nAt 7 days, a second comparator reading is taken (called 7 day reading) and the specimens are placed on the drying room racks. This is the start of air curing, which should continue to minimum 56 days, but ideally to 365 days. Subsequent shrinkage readings are taken at an array of ages, often including, but not limited to 14, 21, 28, 35, 56, 90, 180 and 365 days.\nThe pertinent value calculated from shrinkage test results is \u0394L. \u0394L is the length change in percent (%) of a specimen relative to the specimens initial (1 day) reading.\nIn this bulletin, negative \u0394L values represent beam expansion, which is likely to occur during wet curing, with positive \u0394L values representing beam shrinkage occurring during air curing.\nAverage CRD and \u0394L values for 3 shrinkage specimens is depicted in the table below. \u0394L is easily calculated using the length change equation shown above and CRD data. The next step is to graphically plot \u0394L or Length Change (%) on the Y axis versus Time (days) on the X axis. 365 day data is not depicted because it unnecessarily extends the length of the X axis, thereby compressing critical 0-90 day shrinkage data. Finally, ECLIPSE\u00ae concrete shrinkage data expressed as percent reduction compared to reference concrete is shown at right at 28, 90 and 365 days. This is the pertinent information engineers and specifiers will be requiring for confirmation of ECLIPSE\u00ae shrinkage performance.\nECLIPSE is a trademark, which may be registered in the United States and/or other countries, of GCP Applied Technologies Inc.

We aim to inspire application of that knowledge, for further discovery and impact, to help people achieve improved health outcomes. One major way achievement of that goal is reflected is in the number of times a scientific paper is cited \u2013 with high citation numbers correlating highly with peer approval. This is evidence of scientific peers acknowledging the research reported in the scientific paper.\nOnly the most pre-eminent researchers earn the distinction of \u2018Highly Cited Researcher\u2019; that is, their papers have been ranked in the top 1% by citations over the past 11 years by Clarivate Analytics, considering both year and field of publication. Professors Fornito and Y\u00fccel are, once again, two of them.\nProfessor Fornito has had another successful year, with the award of a Universal Scientific Education and Research Network (USERN) Prize. He has also received the 2018 Gottschalk Medal from the Australian Academy of Science.\nMICCN is extremely proud of Professors Fornito and Y\u00fccel, and congratulates them on their overwhelming success.\nCongratulations also to all 22 Monash academics who featured in this year\u2019s list.\nFor more information on Professor Alex Fornito\u2019s research, contact him on T: 03 9902 9796, E: Alex.Fornito@monash.edu.\nFor more information on Professor Murat Y\u00fccel\u2019s research, contact him on T: 03 9902 9765, E: Murat.Yucel@monash.edu.",

Economists polled by Reuters had expected a decline to 100.0.\nThe index was weighed down by less optimistic consumers, retailers and industry. The only sectors where sentiment improved slightly in September were services and construction.\nThe declining optimism was mirrored by a fall in the business climate indicator for the euro zone, which the Commission said stood at 0.07 in September, down from 0.16 in August, the lowest level since October 2013.\nConsumer inflation expectations, measured as anticipated consumer price trends over the next 12 months, fell to 4.0 this month from 6.6 in August, continuing a steady decline since December 2013, when they stood at 15.1.\nSelling price expectations among manufacturers, the equivalent of producer price inflation expectations, also fell to -1.8 from -0.7 in August.\nThe declining inflation expectations underline the very low inflationary pressures in the stagnating euro zone economy that the European Central Bank wants to prevent from turning into deflation by flooding the market with ultra-cheap cash.",

        "instruction": "How did the National and Scottish Strategies for Carers impact the services provided by the Carers Centre?: The Dumfries and Galloway Carers Centre was established in 1996 following a lot of hard work by a group of Carers and those interested in creating a support organisation for Carers in Dumfries and Galloway. This group became the initial Management Board for the new service. Funded by the local Council, local NHS and funds secured by the Princess Royal Trust for Carers nationally the first two members of staff (including the now Manager, Claudine Brindle) set out to develop the service for, and with, Carers. Work started in a tiny office in Great King Street and then the first Carers Centre on Bank Street opened its doors in February 1997 with the HRH Princess Royal's official opening a year later.\nOver the first five years the organisation worked locally with Carers to provide information, advice and support. The team increased to six staff based throughout Dumfries and Galloway. In response to the first National Strategy for Carers in 1999 and the subsequent Scottish Strategy for Carers in 2000, the Carers Centre worked with local commissioners to include Carers views in the development of the first ever Dumfries and Galloway Carers Strategy. This was launched in 2001 and as a result extra funding was obtained to allow further services to be developed, namely: the Hospital Carers support service; the Young Carers Project; and the Carers Training Project. As a result the staff team quickly doubled.\nIn 2005 the Carers Centre moved to larger premises in Nith Street to offer improved services to Carers - training, groups and wellbeing activities could now be offered on site. This offered Carers access to staff at the same time as attending events. A dedicated Young Carers space was also created ensuring the children and young people had a place to meet.\nAgain the Centre has assisted in the recently launched new Carers Strategy which will see new and existing services developed in response to the needs of Carers locally. Over 7000 individual Carers have registered since inception with an average of 450 new Carers registering each year. All are provided with a quality service that aims to improve the outcomes for Carers living in Dumfries and Galloway.",
