I wanted to scratch the itch and begin to help others do what I had just spent a decade doing.\nI launched what would eventually become the Blog Marketing Academy in late 2008. And I very soon went into creating my own flagship course for \"problogging\".\nThat course was the Blog Masters Club. Launched in late 2009 and again in 2010, the Blog Masters Club is a 16-module flagship training course for bloggers looking to \"go pro\". The course covers everything from design, SEO and traffic... to membership sites, product creation and scaling. The goal was to cover the range of necessary topics for this entire business... all in one course.\nThis is a massive course and has seen many hundreds of students, originally launching at a price of $497 and having been promoted by many of the top bloggers in the space the time.\nToday, Blog Masters Club is no longer available as a standalone course. It is only made available to members in the course library.\nYes, the videos were mostly recorded in the 2009-2010 range. Some of the training on social media and SEO has changed, but much of what is discussed is as relevant today as it was then.",

It examines how more brands are incorporating personalised aspects into their products just as new data gathering techniques can give product awareness campaigns a better fit with shopper interests.\nPersonalisation in FMCG as well as luxury items, will endear your brand to consumers and even encourage elusive consumer loyalty. At a time when a more considered shopping style is in fashion, \u2018things unique\u2019 and the \u2018shopping experience\u2019 all count for consumers.\nThe sustained consumer interest in subscription services can be seen as evidence of the greater interest in a more personalised purchasing style as it meets diverse consumer needs such as an appreciation of healthier living, convenience and novelty. The personalised approach of subscription services also complements the shift towards prioritised spending.\nTech developments in manufacturing and distribution are enabling producers of mass-produced goods to incorporate personalised elements into what they sell to increase consumer appeal, at a time when consumption with a more individualistic style is celebrated.\nThe whole sphere of \u2018inbound marketing\u2019 built to appeal to onliners with information that is interesting and relevant to them, and facilitated by technical advances, is based on a more personalised form of outreach that focuses on consumers rather than product sales. The knowledge gleaned from consumer tastes and already reflected in website navigation design can be harnessed by brands to help them tailor what they are promoting to current and future clients, enticing the \u2018right consumer\u2019 with the \u2018right content\u2019 that engages them, and so is more likely to turn visitors into customers.

March 22, 1930) is an American stage musical and film composer and lyricist, one of the few people to win an Academy Award, multiple Tony Awards (seven, more than any other composer), multiple Grammy Awards, and a Pulitzer Prize. He has been described by Frank Rich in the The New York Times as \"the greatest and perhaps best-known artist in the American musical theater.\"  His most famous scores include (as composer/lyricist) A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, Company, Follies, A Little Night Music, Sweeney Todd, Sunday in the Park with George, Into the Woods, and Assassins, as well as the lyrics for West Side Story and Gypsy. He was president of the Dramatists Guild from 1973 to 1981. Stephen Sondheim was born to Herbert and Janet (\"Foxy\") Sondheim, in New York City, New York, and grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and later on a farm in Pennsylvania. Herbert was a dress manufacturer and Foxy designed the dresses. While his mother had grown up in an Orthodox Jewish family, Sondheim had no formal religious education or association, did not have a Bar Mitzvah, and reportedly did not set foot in a synagogue until he was nineteen. An only child of well-to-do parents living in a high-rise apartment on Central Park West, Sondheim's childhood has been portrayed as isolated and emotionally neglected in Meryl Secrest's biography, Sondheim: A Life. Based on the material, what can you tell us about Stephen Sondheim's upbringing and family background, and how has it been portrayed in his biography?",

In Italy, it wasn\u2019t until the 1700s that tomatoes were used as a pizza topping, and it wasn\u2019t until the late 19th century that the popular pizza we know today started to become popular.\n\nIn 1889, Raffaele Esposito of Naples created the classic margherita pizza for visiting royalty. This pizza was made with fresh mozzarella and tomato, reflecting the colors of the Italian flag. It quickly became popular with the masses and soon spread to other countries. \n\nIn the United States, pizza began to gain popularity in the early 1900s. The first American pizzeria was opened in 1905 in New York. By the 1950s, pizza was a popular food choice in the United States, and chains like Pizza Hut and Domino\u2019s started to pop up. \n\nIn more recent times, pizza has continued to evolve. Different types of pizza such as deep dish and stuffed crust have become popular in different parts of the United States. And new toppings like beef, chicken, and vegetarian toppings have been added to the traditional margherita pizza. Pizza is now an international food enjoyed by people around the world. \n\nIn conclusion, pizza is a delicious food that has evolved over centuries. It has spread to different countries and cultures and continues to evolve. From its peasant origins to today, pizza remains a popular food choice and continues to be enjoyed by people of all ages.",

It is more important than ever that responsible citizens and governments take action to protect our environment and ensure a healthy planet for future generations to come. \n\nTo make meaningful progress, we must consider both natural and man-made factors that contribute to climate change. For example, the burning of fossil fuels releases gases such as carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. These gases trap heat within the atmosphere, warming the planet. To help limit the effects of this process, we must reduce our collective carbon footprint. This means reducing our reliance on fossil fuels, investing in renewable energy resources, and enacting policies that reduce the total amount of greenhouse gas pollution. \n\nThough change is difficult and uncomfortable, we must take action to ensure a hospitable planet for generations to come. We must start now, as every day of delay increases the risks we face.

As the school population grew, faculty and students moved to a new building at 3401 N. Meridian Street in 1928. The school was briefly closed in the 1980s and reopened as a middle school, then became a magnet high school which now specializes in International Baccalaureate and Arts & Humanities. The Shortridge High School Digital Collection contains photographs and other materials that highlight the school&apos;s history, students, faculty and activities.

Sometimes, having dedicated and long-term volunteers can be a tricky feat. We\u2019ve put together a list of to-dos for non-profits like yours to keep their volunteers committed and interested. Some of your volunteers may be natural leaders. Given the opportunity, they may go above and beyond what is requested of them. Allow opportunities for volunteers to be advisors, managers, or board members. After someone has donated to your organization, respond with a thank you and a rough idea of the level of impact that the donation made, incentivizing people to continue to give. Introduce a leveled system according to donation size. Ask a group of your most dedicated volunteers to match what your target volunteers help with for a certain amount of time. Take matching past donations and double your volunteer productivity. Hold meetings for volunteers in different areas. Meetings are vital to making sure that volunteers have a sense of direction going forward. Have a member of the organization attend and foster a sense of community. The more comfortable volunteers feel, the more willing they will be to help. Make the volunteers know that they are more than just numbers to your organization by respecting them. Think about your volunteers\u2019 motives. Cater to why you think they\u2019re donating their time to your organization and make the experience as fun as possible. Kate Dragonetti is a freelance writer for DipJar. She spent four years raising funds and going on builds for Habitat for Humanity and plans on continuing to be a dedicated volunteer.

He retired from the NFL in 2008 and was diagnosed with ALS in 2011.\nHe has since spearheaded efforts through the Team Gleason foundation to develop and provide technology to help ALS patients live longer, more fulfilling lives. Those include devices that track eye movements to help paralyzed people type words that can be transformed into speech. Gleason has used the technology to communicate, post messages on social media, address lawmakers from around the world and give motivational speeches to athletes.\nCongress last year approved the Gleason Act, which provided funding to help ALS patients get such devices.
