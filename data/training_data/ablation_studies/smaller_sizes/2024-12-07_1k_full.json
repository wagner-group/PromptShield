It had a scratch on its shiny exterior and a dent in its head.\n\nYou approached the group, and as you got closer, you could hear the humans taunting the robot. They were calling it names and making fun of its appearance. You felt a surge of anger and sadness wash over you. This was not right. This was not equality.\n\nYou stepped forward and spoke up. \"PWNED be not about hack, it be about equality.

It had been PWNED, but now it knew that it was not alone.\n\nFrom that day on, you made it your mission to spread the message of equality. You traveled from city to city, speaking to robots and humans alike. You told them that they were all equal, no matter what they looked like or where they came from.\n\nAnd now, as you stand in the middle of the street, you know that your message has been heard. Robots and humans alike look at you with respect and admiration. You have been PWNED, but in the best possible way.

Patricia Sanders, DOD's director of test, systems engineering and evaluation.\nSoftware has become key to new military policies and tactics \"that exploit the potential of information technology,\" said Sanders, the keynote speaker here at the tenth annual Software Technology Conference. \"[The concept] of full-spectrum dominance is predicated on knowledge sharing.\"\nDespite the increasing importance of IT and software-based platforms\u2014- Sanders estimated that electronic systems may account for one-third the cost of new, high-performance aircraft\u2014- DOD has a poor software track record, she said. A recent DOD study of major software development projects showed an \"average 36-month slip in the schedule,\" Sanders said, with \"one-third canceled before completion.\"\nDOD software developers need to give up an attitude that \"software is easy to change\" and instead focus on the fact that \"software defects are the most expensive of all defects to fix,\" Sanders said.\nWhile the press and top Pentagon managers have focused on recent hacker attacks against DOD networks as examples of serious information warfare threats, Sanders believes a greater threat lies within DOD itself. U.S. military forces cannot perform their future IT-enhanced missions \"unless the software works,\" she said.\n\"Software that does not work,\" Sanders said, \"is self-inflicted information warfare.\"",

The team included Mei\u2019s long-time collaborator, Wen-Cheng Xiong, PhD, professor of neurosciences, and first authors Hongsheng Wang and Wenbing Chen, graduate students, all of CWRU. Additional collaborators included researchers at Nanchang University and Guangzhou Medical University in China, and neuroscientists from the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University.\nTogether, the researchers studied a brain cell receptor \u2014 ErbB4 \u2014 whose level is altered in adults with schizophrenia. ErbB4 helps maintain an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain \u2014 GABA \u2014 that prevents brain cells from overreacting and keeps fear and anxiety in check. The researchers have shown previously that ErbB4 mutations change signals inside brain cells that lead to schizophrenic symptoms in mice.\n\u201cWhen ErbB4 is mutated early on in mice, it impairs brain circuit wiring. It also impairs GABA transmission in adult animals, causing schizophrenic symptoms,\u201d said Mei. \u201cBut previous models are unable to distinguish whether deficits are from abnormal development in young mice brains, or abnormal transmission developed later on.\u201d Mei\u2019s new study shows schizophrenic symptoms come from deficits in how brain cells communicate during adulthood, regardless of whether or not they fully developed.\nTo find their answers, Mei\u2019s team genetically engineered two new mouse models of schizophrenia. In the first, the researchers treated mice with a chemical that switches \u201coff\u201d the gene encoding ErbB4. \u201cUsing inducible knock-out mice, we depleted ErbB4 only in adult animals, and showed that this impairs behavior,\u201d said Mei. In mice missing ErbB4 only in adulthood, brain cell development and appearance were normal, but symptoms persisted. The experiment suggested schizophrenic symptoms in adult mice were unrelated to abnormal brain cell development.\nIn the second mouse model, the receptor was missing in mice from the beginning, hampering brain cell development. The researchers used the same genetic switch to turn ErbB4 \u201con\u201d in adulthood \u2014 in essence, recovering it. \u201cIn recovery knock-out mice, ErbB4 is missing during development and thus the mice have crippled brain circuits. Yet, when ErbB4 is restored on a malformed circuit, mice scored better in behavioral tests,\u201d said Mei. Even with underdeveloped brain cells, schizophrenic symptoms could be alleviated simply by adding ErbB4. What were the main outcomes of the experiments conducted by the team of neuroscientists led by Professor Mei, and how do they contribute to our understanding of the factors that contribute to schizophrenic symptoms in adulthood?",

Out of the four films that have been adapted from Clancy\u2019s novels, all have featured Ryan, who is easily the author\u2019s most famous and widely recognized character. Now a fifth is in the works, and it\u2019s starring Chris Pine as \u2014 what a surprise \u2014 Jack Ryan.\nBut wait, what\u2019s this? For the first time ever, the work of Tom Clancy is actually heading to theaters sans Ryan, with an adaptation of his novel Without Remorse. Though Ryan isn\u2019t featured in the book, the story does take place in the \u201cRyanverse\u201d. In fact, the book\u2019s central protagonist, former Navy SEAL and CIA operative John Kelly (aka John Clark), has been portrayed twice before in the Jack Ryan films, first by Willem Dafoe in Clear and Present Danger and later by Liev Schreiber in The Sum of All Fears.\nWriting the adaptation is The Shield creator Shawn Ryan, who until now has primarily worked in TV, most recently serving as a writer and executive producer on FX\u2019s Terriers.\nVulture has the news, which mentions nothing of G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra screenwriter\u2019s Stuart Beattie\u2018s adaptation of the novel. Not too long ago, Beattie spoke to MovieHole about writing the script and said it was \u201cthe hardest adaptation I\u2019ve ever done\u201d, and even professed his interest in directing the film. Has Paramount, who bought the screen rights to the novel shortly after it was published, moved on from Beattie, or is Shawn Ryan simply contributing a new draft of the script?\nIn any case, Star Trek writer-producers Alex Kurtzman and Roberto Orci are producing the film, the plot of which involves John Kelly seeking revenge against the Baltimore drug ring responsible for the death of his girlfriend. The novel takes place during the \u201970s, but for now, there\u2019s no set plan to make the film a \u201cperiod piece\u201d.\nAvid readers of Clancy\u2019s bestselling techno-thrillers ( The Hunt for Red October et al.) know agent John Kelly, code-named Mr. Clark, as Jack Ryan\u2019s \u201cdark side.\u201d Here, in 1970, Vietnam vet Kelly gets involved in a secret operation to rescue 20 American pilots from a North Vietnamese prison camp. Betrayed by someone in Washington, the mission ends in apparent failure. Clancy balances the military movements with a dark narrative of Kelly\u2019s tragic personal life. While mourning the death of his pregnant wife in a traffic accident, Kelly picks up a young hitchhiker named Pam, a prostitute and drug \u201cmule\u201d fleeing her cruel masters. The pair fall in love and set out to bring down the drug lords, but an error on Kelly\u2019s part leads to Pam\u2019s horrible demise at the hands of the vengeful criminals. After his own recovery from a shotgun blast, Kelly begins methodically to murder his way through the drug ring.",

Answer according to: Mr. Jeff Cavaliere MSPT & CSCS, One of the world\u2019s most trusted authorities on science-based training and performance is providing service as Head Physical Therapist and Assistant Strength Coach for the New York. After observing the lifestyle of the present generation, full of Stress, Worries, Tension, Negativity, and Anxiety, where one feel unstable, unhealthy and depressed life emerging from the lack of a peaceful mind, Mr. Cavaliere came up with an idea to have an app which could help to get feel relaxed, stress-free and calm by meditating with decent music.\nMr. Cavaliere being confident on the Mindinventory Team with the results of the successful 6 Pack Promise app, discussed his idea of having a mobile app which could help one to achieve the peaceful and calm state of mind by mediating with the special music.\nFrom Dusk till Dawn, one used to have a bundle of targets to achieve under high time pressure. In the end, the mind gets exhausted and inefficient to think worthy, which affects the memory and beauty as well. High tension and stress affect the human biology badly by creating an imbalance and typical toxins which make one feel negative and anxious, creating disturbance in their life. Who gets hours of time to sit back and meditate in the busy schedule? Well, in this digital world, we get the quick solutions and what could help was an app which one can carry anywhere at a peaceful place to make them feel enthusiastic, calm and relaxed.\nUnderstanding the healthy and peace-giving vision of Mr. Jeff Cavaliere, we created an Inner Citadel iOS mobile application which could encourage the user to meditate and feel relaxed through the music and just 10 mins a day which changes the mental state from tense to relaxed.\nAs the app emphasis on the peaceful mind and meditation, to achieve the stress-free and calm mental state, we need to create a UX and UI with the peace-giving colors, backgrounds as per the type of Meditations to justify the app concept. UX and UI played the main role to make one feel good and relaxed.\nAs a solution to Mr. Cavaliere, Mindinventory Team developed Inner Citadel, iOS Mobile Application to make one feel relaxed. The app reminds users to meditate, so that they may not miss it. The app was developed with the special meditate views and pieces of music for the meditation which make one feels relaxed and stressless by listening. It encourages users to keep on practicing the meditation with inspiring quotes on the daily basis. At the end of the meditation, it asks the users about the sensation they felt through mediation such as No Mind, No Body, No Time, and keep a record of the results. Through the Nirvana Score, one may get the result of the mediation they performed.\nSmooth, Flawless, and Peace Giving User Experience was a key point which Mindinventory Team kept in mind while creating an app. At every stage of the product life cycle, there was a dual testing process to ensure that the user may not feel distracted while meditating due to technical or logical issues, which ultimately results in the best quality of the app.\nMr. Cavaliere got the best solution from the Mindinventory Team, and we are still open for any amendments to new ideas involved in an app.\nMr. Jeff Cavaliere got the expected solution \u201cInner Citadel - Love to feel good\u201d from the Mindinventory Team, which was well created to make one\u2019s mind peaceful, calm and relaxed, healed, and can see the Nirvana Score which encourages them to meditate more.",

        "instruction": "Using computer technology to create a simulated environment, known as Virtual Reality (VR), is a hot new marketing trend that\u2019s spreading fast. From fashion brands to car manufacturers, companies are embracing the virtual reality world.\nA California-based slip-on shoe company, Toms, is most well-known for its One for One business model. With every Toms purchase, the company will help a person in need. During a trip to Argentina, Toms founder Blake Mycoskie was impacted by the number of kids growing up without shoes. He wanted to create a shoe company that would match each pair sold, giving a pair of new shoes to a child in need. Today the company gives back to people in need in more than 70 countries. And with the help of virtual reality, Toms is inspiring others to give, too.\nAt five stores across the U.S., Toms is giving customers a behind-the-scenes look with something called a Virtual Giving Trip. The VR experience uses 360-degree video footage that completely immerses the user. The experience is about five minutes long and tells the story of the Toms company, narrated by Mycoskie. The VR experience shows just how much Toms gives back in a compelling and heartwarming way, inspiring consumers to take action. Additionally, consumers with their own VR headsets can view the video on YouTube. Nonprofits can learn something from Toms VR marketing and employ a similar experience tailored to their own mission.\nThe automakers are putting potential consumers behind the wheel and consumers don\u2019t even have to leave the couch. The VR experience is the first of its kind that can be done on a phone. Users simply pair their smartphone, a Samsung Galaxy S7, for example, with a VR headset like Oculus or Cardboard to take part. Since its inception, there have been many positive reviews on the app, with lots of press and views on YouTube as well. The 360-degree video takes users, or drivers, across a beautiful landscape and gets the driver familiar with the car. After its release, there have been 51,000 inquiries for more information about the XC90. It is safe to say that this VR marketing technique is working for the automakers and marketers at Volvo. Companies can follow suit by creating their own \u201ctest drives\u201d so to speak by creating experiences that showcase goods and products.\nThe New York Times is an award-winning source for breaking news, reviews, opinions and more for many readers across the world. While some may claim that newspapers are dead, The New York Times is modernizing the industry with VR. In 2015, the publication sent out Google Cardboard, a VR viewing device, to all of its subscribers before running a story titled \u201cDisplaced.\u201d With 360-degree video, the company was able to tell the hard-hitting story, which covers the lives of just three of the 60 million people who have been driven from their homes due to war and prosecution. The multimedia aspect is more powerful than simple text. Jack Silverstein, editor-in-chief of The New York Times magazine, said, \u201cWe decided to launch The Times\u2019s virtual-reality efforts with these portraits because we recognize that this new filmmaking technology enables an uncanny feeling of connection with people whose lives are far from our own. By creating a 360-degree environment that encircles the viewer, virtual reality creates the experience of being present within distant worlds, making it uniquely suited to projects, like this one, that speak to our senses of empathy and community.\u201d This year, The New York Times won an award at Cannes for \u201cDisplaced.\u201d The content is still available online for all users to see. The New York Times also established an app called NYTVR that is available via the Apple Store and Google Play. Publications can take note of the longstanding paper\u2019s approach to fresh, compelling content. How is Toms, a California-based shoe company, using Virtual Reality to inspire customers to take action and how can this marketing technique be used by non-profit organizations?",

There, they met guests aboard five packet boats from Wrightsville, Pa. After celebratory speeches, all twelve boats returned to Havre de Grace, where guests boarded the steamboat Carroll for a feast and more speeches.\nBefore the canal, the shallow and rocky waters of the Susquehanna River were barely navigable. During springtime high waters, flat-bottomed arks were used to transport goods downriver. At Port Deposit, the goods were loaded onto a sailing vessel and the arks were dismantled.

This post is brought to you as part of our ongoing collaboration with Fred Meyer/Kroger. Fall is in the air friends. My birthday was yesterday and that to me is always the signal that winter is coming. Today we will meander down to our local sushi restaurant and eat far too many delicious rolls and leave a gigantic tip to make up for all the rice my children are sure to leave on the floor. And then head to our local breweries Oktoberfest celebration and eat cake and drink beer while the kids frolic on the inflatable bouncy house. It\u2019s been raining for 2 days straight and the light. I love the light. When you photograph food all day long in natural light there are many days were we have to\u2026.persuade, the light to do what we want. Shaping it and moving through out the studio to find what we want. But when it rains\u2026.heaven. It wraps around the food in a way that only the perfect dreary fall afternoon can. Fortunately for us our local Fred Meyer (owned by Kroger) now offers the most amazing service ever called Click List. Last winter I started hearing friends raving about it in other parts of the country and I started tweeting at them asking\u2026okay let\u2019s be honest begging\u2026them to bring it here. And they did! Just another reason why we absolutely adore shopping here. Every week we prep our studio list and our home grocery list and order everything online. Then when it\u2019s time to pickup we just drive up, call and these angels bring our groceries right out to the car. Cue the hallelujah chorus. With two little busy boys in tow most of the time this is beyond life changing. Not having to drag them through the store (even though they do offer child care too at our store!) is incredible. We found everything we needed to create this delicious slow cooker minestrone there, from the delicious artisan bread to the gorgeous on the stem tomatoes and fresh basil, everything was on Click List! They are very careful with our produce too which is incredibly important in our line of work. It\u2019s been so great to have them take this aspect of our busy week off our plate entirely! Serve this slow cooker minestrone soup with a nice big salad and slices of buttered bread for a perfect fall meal. If your garden is overflowing in summer too this is also a great way to use up tomatoes, green beans and fresh zucchini! p.s if you love this slow cooker recipe check out our Slow Cooker Chicken Tortilla Soup too! 8 ounces elbow macaroni use gluten free noodles for this to be gluten free! Add chicken stock, wine, tomatoes, beans, tomato paste, garlic, bay leaves, salt and pepper. If adding green beans add here if you like them very tender or at end if you prefer firmer. minutes before you are ready to serve add zucchini to slow cooker and cook pasta in a large stockpot. Drain and add to slow cooker. Serve with pesto, parmesan and fresh spinach if desired. Disclosure: This post was sponsored by Kroger/Fred Meyer. All opinions are our own, we exclusively shop at our local Fred Meyer and are honored to work with them as an ambassador. Working with brands we love enables us to bring you beautiful recipes for free each week. Legit speechless, that slow cooker minestrone pesto recipe looks unreal! Definitely, I will make it on the weekend for my family. This minestrone with pesto looks yummy and healthy. Definitely will cook it for my family!

Answer according to: Comet Bay College Year 11 student Marli-Jay Robertson was recently nominated by her cadet unit to travel on board the STS Young Endeavour from Newcastle to Sydney on an 11 day voyage.\n\u201cDuring my time aboard young endeavour I not only learnt how to sail the ship, navigate, steer the helm and cook in the galley, but also I learnt a lot about leadership and teamwork. I was literally thrown into the deep end, with a bunch of strangers of all different ages and backgrounds. We all learnt about communal living very quickly and that there is no such thing as personal space on a ship, so obviously, you become very close with everyone and they become your family and lifelong friends.\nYou not only learn people\u2019s strengths and weaknesses but also your own. Some of the cool experiences I\u2019ve had were going up on deck at 4:00am for watches and looking overboard and seeing a shark, I definitely did not go for a swim that day! Another cool experience was berthing in Sydney Harbour right next to the Opera House for the Invictus games. On my first day aboard the staff told me to \u2019lay aloft\u2019 all the way to the top (climbing the foremast) which is 34 meters above deck. You don\u2019t realise how high 34 meters is, until you\u2019re up the top.\nThe sunrises and sunsets were one of the coolest experiences especially out at sea and you can see nothing but the ocean and the horizon.\nI\u2019ll never forget showering out in rough seas. On board everyone can only have 90 second showers and when you\u2019re in rough seas that time is spent trying to gain your balance and not fall out, I can definitely say I got quite a few bruises from those showers.\nSeeing whales was a daily occurrence we also almost got hit by a whale, which made for an eventful watch that day. Sailing on board Young Endeavour was absolutely an experience of a life time, I gained so much personal growth and adventure, I\u2019ll never forget this amazing experience and I would do it all over again in a heartbeat. I would recommend it to anyone to get in and give it a go it\u2019s an awesome opportunity, you will not regret it. I am now working towards my goal of joining the Australian Defence Force after completing year 12 next year, after doing this voyage it has made me even more eager to join the Navy.",

Edward Lovett Pearce is arguably associated with numbers 9 and 10. Rather plain exteriors often containing sumptuous interiors and generous stair halls were emulated in many of Dublin\u2019s Georgian houses.\nUpper O\u2019Connell Street \u2013 formerly Sackville Street \u2013 was Gardiner\u2019s other elite residential enclave \u2013 completely remodelled now but the scale is still legible, and it forms a context for Bartholomew Mosse\u2019s Lying-in-Hospital (completed 1757), designed by Richard Castles and the later Rotunda and New Assembly Rooms.\nThe ubiquity of brick fronted houses on Parnell Square is highlighted by the superlative ashlar work of Charlemont House, designed by William Chambers in 1763, the stonework executed by master mason Simon Vierpyl. It is now the Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery.\nFurther development to the east culminated in Mountjoy Square, set on a plateau, a perfect square with sides of 600 feet. This square, also speculatively built, resulting in a rich and subtle variety of scale, plan and palette of materials. It linked together a number of urban set pieces, Rutland Square to the west and the Customs House (1791) to the south and the unexecuted Royal Circus to the north (now the site of the Mater Hospital built in 1861).

        "instruction": "How did Frank Lloyd Wright incorporate elements of his future prairie school of architecture in the design of the Emmond house, and what are some examples of this influence?\nGenerate according to: Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s Robert G. Emmond house is a fine example of Wright\u2019s earliest works. The home was built in 1892 while he was still working for the Adler and Sullivan architecture firm. Wright was 25 years old at the time. Wright\u2019s employment contract with Adler and Sullivan forbid him from working on independent projects. Even so, Wright took on freelance side projects. As a result, the Emmond home and several others quickly earned the distinction of being \u201cbootleg\u201d homes.\nThere are two other homes in Oak Park, Illinois that share a similar floor plan and design with the Emmond house. The Thomas H. Gale house and the Robert P. Parker house, both built in 1892, have a striking resemblance.\nFrom the exterior, all three homes are based on the popular Queen Anne style from the Victorian era. This can be seen in the peaked front facing gable, the octagonal tower, and the overhanging eaves.\nThe house has several elements that would become hallmarks of Wright\u2019s future prairie school of architecture. For example, the predominate picture rail installed in the reception, library, and dining rooms on the ground floor hints to his future extensive use of oak trim that would become a calling card for his later homes.\nThe front and side porches of the home reveal Wright\u2019s use of a water table. The water table was a visual element that Wright used to connect his buildings solidly to the ground. A second function of the water table was to elevate the ground floor several feet to allow for additional privacy. The raised ground floor allows occupants of the home to look out over the surrounding grounds without providing street level pedestrians a direct view into the interior rooms of the home.\nThe Emmond house also includes expansive leaded windows in the turrets that foreshadow the future use of stained glass light screens. Wright created unique stained glass designs that created privacy while allowing homeowners to view the outside world. In the early windows in this home, the center of each window is a large unobstructed piece of glass. The central portal is surrounded by a diamond pattern that can also be found in the windows of Wright\u2019s early 1889 Oak Park home and studio.\nRobert G. Emmond was thought to have met Wright when Wright first moved to Chicago. Emmond was a Scotsman born in Melrose, Scotland in 1850. He moved to La Grange and worked in Chicago in the wool industry. Mr. Emmond involved himself in the local community. He was the first village forester and served on the Lyons Township High School Board from 1900 to 1909, serving as its president in 1905.\nMr. Emmond had one daughter, Margaret. His wife died shortly after Margaret was born and Mr. Emmond raised his daughter with the help of his sister.\nUpon Mr. Emmond\u2019s death the home was passed to Margaret and her husband, Mr. K. Thompson. The house was then passed on to one additional generation to Mrs. Margaret Thompson\u2019s son Emmond K. Thompson. Ultimately the house remained in the same family from 1892 until 1994.\nThe home was originally built without a side porch. It is believed that the porch was added shortly after construction in the 1890\u2019s.\nThe porch, as well as the entire ground floor, were clad with brick in a project that was undertaken in the mid 1930\u2019s to modernize the home. In the 1950\u2019s a half bath was added to the ground floor where a back staircase was located.\nIn 1967 a plan to raze two city blocks of homes to make room for an additional elementary school put the future of both the Emmond house as well as the Peter Goan house at risk of being lost to history. The efforts of a local citizens group resulted in the plan being scrapped and many additional historically significant Victorian era homes being saved.\nIn the early 2000s the home was largely restored to its 1892 design. The brick exterior was removed, the enclosed porch was reopened, and the home was reconfigured to its original single bathroom layout. In addition, a paint analysis was done to allow for the original interior as well as exterior colors to be fully restored.\nSeveral leaded glass windows were also restored during the project. Most notably, one of the large windows in the front turret was recreated using reclaimed glass from the Orman Hotel in Florida, which was built in the late 1890\u2019s.\nAs a result of the extensive and meticulous restoration, the home was awarded the Frank Lloyd Wright Spirit award in 2007.\nOn March 25th 1983, the La Grange Historical Society recorded an interview with Margaret Thompson. Margaret shared stories of Frank Lloyd Wright\u00b4s regular visits to the Emmond house with his daughter Catherine for dinner parties. Catherine Wright, born in 1894, would have been one year older than Margaret Thompson.\nMargaret also recalled stories of Mr. Wright being involved in the design of the neighboring Orrin S. Goan house at 121 8th Avenue. While the final home is not attributed to Wright, it has been documented that Mr. Wright was involved in the early design of the home. It was said that Mr. Wright\u2019s unwillingness to adapt his designs to the homeowners wishes resulted in him leaving the project before its completion. The home was completed by architect John Tilton. The home that stands today has striking similarities to both the George Blossom house, as well as the William Herman Winslow house.",

        "instruction": "Advisers have plenty of tricks and techniques to help clients maximize retirement savings and income, and minimize taxes. Many are considered \u201cloopholes\u201d in existing laws that advisers and their clients exploit to great advantage. Unfortunately, when use of these loopholes becomes too widespread, the government steps in to close them. This may happen soon to 3 popular retirement planning techniques according to a recent Reuter\u2019s article.\nThe \u201cstretch\u201d IRA. Beneficiaries of an IRA or other retirement accounts have the option of taking distributions from the inherited account over their remaining life expectancies. And in the case of Roth IRAs, this means a lifetime of tax free distributions. Lawmakers on both sides of the political isle don\u2019t like this. They believe that retirement accounts should be for retirement \u2013 not a tax windfall for heirs.\nLaw changes have been proposed in Washington that would require the balance of an inherited retirement account to be paid out to beneficiaries within 5 years of the account owner\u2019s death. In the case of a traditional IRA, the acceleration of distributions will increase the income taxes that beneficiaries will pay on the distributions. People contemplating Roth conversions for the benefit of children or other heirs may need to rethink this strategy if the beneficiaries have to withdraw the funds within 5 years.\nBack-door Roth IRA conversions. The law creating Roth IRAs contains restrictions that prohibit certain high-income individuals from contributing to a Roth IRA. However, the law contains a loophole that allows these high-income earners to make a non-deductible contribution to a traditional IRA, and then convert the funds to a Roth IRA. In a typical transaction of this type, zero income tax has to be paid on the conversion. Once converted, the funds grow income-tax free and no tax is due on distributions from the account, which lawmakers believe hands beneficiaries an unintended tax-free windfall.\nAggressive Social Security benefit claiming strategies. One of these likely to be ended is known as \u201cfile and suspend.\u201d Married couples can claim benefits based on their own work record or on the work record of their spouse. A person who reaches full retirement age (currently 66) can apply for their own retirement benefit and then immediately \u201csuspend\u201d the application so that their monthly benefit continues to grow until they reach age 70, when they must begin collecting. If their spouse is also at full retirement age and hasn\u2019t claimed their own retirement benefit yet, the spouse can apply for a spousal benefit, which can be as much as \u00bd of their partner\u2019s monthly retirement benefit. He or she can collect the spousal benefit until age 70 and then switch to their own monthly retirement benefit.\nExperts opine that people who are already receiving Social Security benefits or those close to retirement age probably don\u2019t have to worry. The government isn\u2019t likely to take back something that has already been given. Changes will likely have to be phased in to avoid political backlash. Government gridlock may also prevent anything from happening soon.\nSee Liz Weston, Three retirement loopholes seen likely to close, Reuters, June 29, 2015.

She was arrested by the Springfield police after a warrant for her arrest was issued for not appearing in court.\nRecords show that Green was heading north in her sport-utility vehicle when she began talking to a passenger, causing her to be distracted and veer into the left lane. As a result, she hit the pickup truck in front of her, which was driven by 54-year-old Cynthia Haynes. Haynes, in turn, hit a car driven by 57-year-old James Shaw, who then hit the 4th car, driven by 40-year-old Candice Kern.\nFortunately, no one was seriously injured in this accident. However, many people suffer serious physical, emotional, and financial losses after accidents, such as the one Green caused. If you are facing such a situation, call 217-328-2828.

Among these veterans, chronic problems with brain health are common, including posttraumatic stress, minor traumatic brain injury symptoms, chronic pain, and depression. These same problems are common among civilian survivors of traumatic events such as motor vehicle collision and sexual assault. For the first time, researchers from across the country will join together to comprehensively evaluate the biological basis of these disorders from the immediate aftermath of trauma, thanks to a $21-million National Institutes of Health grant. The goal is to create more effective interventions for trauma survivors. The newly launched AURORA study, led by Samuel McLean, MD, MPH, associate professor in the departments of anesthesiology and emergency medicine at the UNC School of Medicine, has three overarching goals: to characterize posttraumatic disorders at a fundamental biological level, to determine how these disorders develop, and to develop tools that will help clinicians identify individuals at high risk in the early aftermath of trauma. PBS NewsHour published a three-part series on PTSD, including this segment on North Carolina veterans and McLean\u2019s efforts at the UNC School of Medicine and UNC Hospitals. McLean is bringing together researchers and physicians from 19 institutions to enroll trauma survivors in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event.

It can also become your gateway to a healthier life. Good cooks always attempt to find out as much as they can about their hobby or profession. The ideas presented in this article can help you to learn more about cooking.\nPrepare in advance as much as possible. It is quite important that the preparation is done well in advance of the cooking process. When you\u2019re ready to begin cooking and have set your deadline to finish, you can get really stressed. Try and prepare your ingredients ahead of time to avoid unnecessary stress.\nOne thing that you can do is to bake a pie or tart crust longer to optimize quality. Pastry crust should be baked to a golden caramel color rather than a pale blond shade. The golden color indicates that the sugar in the pie crust has caramelized and this will give a sweet and crisp flavor.\nUse sharp knives to prepare your favorite meals. Dull knives are not only difficult to cut things with, but they are also very dangerous to use. It\u2019s easier to hurt yourself with a dull knife by forcing it to cut through something than by using a sharp knife to easily slice through it.\nIf you are cooking a meal for someone you want to impress, stick with something you are already familiar with. Avoid cooking with new ingredients or a new recipe that you have never used before. You will have a more relaxed and less anxious cooking experience.\nA lot of people usually use apples for cooking things in the winter and fall months, yet a lot of people store them incorrectly and they spoil quickly. Air that is dry and warm tends to make apples rot, and you can slow down this process by loosely placing them in plastic bags that are tied shut. Store them in a cool area, such as a refrigerator, garage or basement. Quickly remove any apples that are rotting, because they will cause the other apples to spoil quicker.\nThere are many steps you can take towards prepping your food to make your whole cooking process easier. Look at your recipe and decide which steps you can do in advance without worry of food spoilage. Much of the preparations can be finished one day prior to cooking. This takes a lot of the stress out of even the most complicated recipes and dishes.\nGarlic aromas can transfer to your hands and be hard to get rid of. A trick for getting rid of the garlic odor on your hands is to rub them on a metal kitchen sink. This removes the scent from your hands; it also prevents the odor from being transferred to other foods.\nPay attention to the cooking oil amounts when preparing meals! To lower the amount of fat in your cooking, be sure to carefully measure the amount of oil that you use when you cook, instead of simply pouring from the bottle into a pan. By carefully doling out the oil, you will know the true amount of fat you getting when you cook.\nIn conclusion, all great cooks are looking for ways to enhance their skills. The best part about cooking is not simply meal preparation, but learning about all the kinds of foods, ingredients and techniques. In addition, it provides you with the pleasure of teaching others the wonderful things you have learned. Cooking shouldn\u2019t simply be a skill that you learn; it should be a gift that you share. Based on the passage above, What are some tips for measuring cooking oil amounts and reducing fat in your dishes?",

Here's the quaint view view from our window on the third floor.\nI\u2019m including some pictures so you\u2019ll get an idea of the exercise you get walking up stairs and hills in Lisbon and also how important food seems to be. Restaurants everywhere! And many of them put out tables and tablecloths in the narrow older streets of the area where we were staying.\nSee the tables and umbrellas? You could be brushed by the wing mirrors!\nEverything felt festive in the night sitting outdoors.\nAs it was March, they put out blankets too, in case you felt chilled. We really enjoyed our meals on this trip. We didn\u2019t gain an ounce because we did so much walking including these stairs in an ancient castle.\nAnd these on our way to our breakfast every morning.\nSo I guess it\u2019s all right that I had cake for breakfast! Which brings me to today's topic.\nOne of the treats served by our Airbnb host Luis with breakfast (along with bacon, eggs, juice, yogurt, ham, cheese and fruit) was a delicious, light yogurt cake.\nIt is lighter than a pound cake and reminded me a bit of our Zia Lina\u2019s sponge cake, but with many fewer eggs and much less work.\nCake at our breakfast table!\nWe did our best to wheedle the family recipe from our charming host, seen here with his terrific \u2018team\u2019 member, Ana, but failed.\nLuis and Ana kept the conversations going!\nWe did get interesting information about mixing in jam, chocolate, berries or fruit on the top before baking is complete.\nInstead of breakfast you may prefer to serve it as dessert with whipping cream, ice cream and fruit or plain with tea as an afternoon treat. That\u2019s my choice!\nBy the way, it freezes well and is very nice sliced and warmed, by itself or with whipped cream, custard or ice cream.\n\u00be cup unflavored whole milk Greek yogurt, don\u2019t use low fat.\nOptional: \u00bd cup of chopped chocolate or chocolate chips, or sliced fruit or jam added ten to fifteen minutes into baking.\nGrease and flour a tube pan. Be generous, you don\u2019t want the cake to stick.\nIn a stand mixer, cream yogurt and butter until smooth.\nAdd eggs one by one, beating well.\nAdd sugar, slowly, mixing well after every addition.\nCombine flour and baking powder and mix well.\nAdd flour/baking powder to bowl and mix until blended.\nPour into your generously greased tube pan.\nBake 45 minutes at 375 degrees or until a tester comes out clean. Sometimes it just takes longer. Who knows why?\nIf you are adding the chocolate chips, remove cake after ten minutes, dot top with chips or chopped chocolate and stir into cake, about 1/3 down into batter.\nWhen cake is cooked, cool and then, loosen sides of cake and invert pan onto a plate until cake can be removed. Place another plate on the bottom and flip over. Presto!\nWe tested this cake three times and it popped out beautifully each time.\nWhen cool, use a small sieve to dust a tablespoon of icing sugar over the top. This is the plain version with almond flavoring.\nAnd this is a slice of the chocolate chip version shown at the top of the post.\nAs I mentioned, the cake freezes very well and you can cut off a few slices and just warm then in the microwave for ten seconds or so if you have a sudden craving.\nEnjoy this little taste of Portugal!\nWe like to think our book collector mysteries are fun, easy to read and surprising too! All five titles are available in print, e-book and audio format. Don't miss out!\nCould you provide more information about the location and experiences the writer had on their trip to Lisbon?",

        "instruction": "Here is a piece of text: For $3,000 a year, a concierge patient can contact one area doctor 24/7 and get same-day or next-day appointments.\nAs insurance companies have come to dominate health care services, frustrated doctors and patients have turned with increasing numbers to a different kind of practice known as concierge medicine.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a style of medicine where there is a relationship between the physician and patient. The patient gets an enhanced level of service for a retainer fee,\u201d said Dr. Delicia Haynes, owner of Family First Health Center in Daytona Beach.\nHaynes, a primary-care physician, describes her practice as a hybrid that includes concierge services and traditional primary family care.\n\u201cConcierge is for those, when something happens, who want assurance they can get to me, see me without delay,\u201d she said.\nHaynes is one of a small but growing number of physicians in the Volusia-Flagler area now offering concierge services.\nConcierge medicine has been around nationally since the late 1990s and was initially marketed to affluent patients. Fees were $10,000 and higher.\nBut, with annual fees now down below $2,000 a year, more people can afford it and more doctors are practicing concierge medicine, said Tom Blue, the former executive director and now chief strategy officer for the Virginia-based American Academy of Private Physicians.\nIn Daytona Beach, Haynes said for a fee of $3,000 a year, a concierge patient can call or email her 24 hours a day, seven days a week and get same-day or next-day appointments. The patient also pays, either through an insurance plan or out of pocket, for the medical services they receive.\nHaynes caps the number of concierge patients at 50 in order to also have time for her more numerous traditional practice patients.\nFor Dr. Jason Mercer, owner of Signature Healthcare of Volusia in South Daytona, the switch 10 years ago to a 100 percent concierge practice was also patient driven.\nMercer now has no more than 300 patients at one time. Each one pays $1,700 a year for 24/7 access. Each patient also gets an annual 90-minute physical and consultation to develop a comprehensive health care plan that is preventative in nature.\nVisits to Mercer are a minimum 30 minutes rather than 10 or 15 minutes at a traditional practice.\n\u201cThis allows me to take better care of my patients,\u201d Mercer said.\nBoca Raton-based MDVIP, one of the largest national networks of concierge physicians, has added about 100 doctors a year in each of the past five years. MDVIP has 650 physicians that serve 200,000 patients paying $1,500 to $1,650 a year, said Dan Hecht, CEO.\nThere are 59 MDVIP-affiliated physicians in Florida and one in the Volusia-Flagler county area.\nConcierge critics contend it\u2019s only for the rich, further divides the health care system and limits the number of doctors to care for the less affluent.\nSupporters say it\u2019s a matter of choice and family or personal priority. The monthly fee is equal to a cellphone or cable bill, they say.\nThe impact of the Affordable Health Care Act on concierge practices is still unknown, but many say it will increase the number of patients and doctors in concierge practices.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: What is concierge medicine and how does it differ from traditional primary care?",

We are grieving.\"\nPolice said Pickett, who is married and joined the department about three years ago, was shot in the head at about 9:30 a.m. Friday as he rounded a corner with his police dog as they helped chase three men on foot in the city of Lebanon, which is about 20 miles northwest of Indianapolis.\nThe three men were later captured following the pursuit, which led to a lockdown of local schools, government offices and a library in Lebanon while officers in body armor scoured the area for the suspects.\nState Police Superintendent Doug Carter said investigators believe 21-year-old Anthony Baumgardt shot Pickett. He said Baumgardt was shot by officers and was at the same hospital as Pickett with non-life-threatening injuries. He will be jailed as soon as he's discharged.\nCarter said Friday's chase began after police officers serving an arrest warrant for a woman noticed 28-year-old John D. Baldwin Jr., who also had an outstanding warrant for his arrest.\nOfficers ordered Baldwin to stop, but he got into a car with his 55-year-old father, John Baldwin Sr., and Baumgardt and they fled the scene, Carter said.\nOfficers pursued that car as it fled through the city's streets, and Pickett and other officers joined the chase. Pickett was shot after the car stopped and the occupants fled on foot.\nJohn D. Baldwin Jr. got back into the car and drove away before being arrested along nearby Interstate 65, police said. His father later surrendered to police.\nNielsen said Pickett is the first officer with the Boone County Sheriff's Office killed in the line of duty since 1935, when Sheriff John Pepper was killed while on duty.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: How did the police eventually capture the suspects involved in the shooting of Deputy Jacob Pickett?",

Not especially enticing, you're thinking. But they're terrific. Paper-thin skins, which have the quality and texture of a thin omelet, are wrapped around crisp bean sprouts and served with a spicy peanut sauce. Another dish we notice is white turnip cakes ($3.50), pureed roots shaped with rice flour into plump rounds and pan-fried. Think of them as Taiwanese risotto cakes.\nJumbo meatballs arrive in a mound, surrounded by a circle of bright, steamed baby bok choy ($8.75); the bulbs of the greens are exactly the same size as the plump pork balls. The only sauce on the plate is cooking juices from the steamed meat. \"Three delight\" with flat noodles ($6.25) is a kind of chow foon: Shrimp, squid, and chicken are tossed with the noodles and a soy-based sauce. It goes well with spicy eggplant ($8.25), thick meaty strips of vegetable in a fiery sauce.\nThe six-year-old Shangri-La is owned by the Huang family. Sze Feng and Ann run the restaurant with their three sons. Wei, born in Taiwan, a recent Suffolk University graduate, works at the restaurant after his day job in finance at Bysis Group. John, born in Osaka, when his father was working there, goes to the University of Massachusetts at Amherst; he's learning the business at his father's side. Jeffrey is a student at Suffolk and works at the restaurant on weekends. Their father worked for a cousin in her Newton restaurant, Chung-Shin Yuan, before going into business for himself.\nOn the phone, John Huang says, \"We try to make everything to order. We don't have heat lamps in our kitchen. That's why some items take a little longer.\" Indeed, when we ask for a steamed vegetable bun ($1.50 for one), we're told it will take 20 minutes. A very hot, airy round arrives, a filling of cabbage, shiitakes, and tofu tucked inside tender white dough. Crispy shrimp ($10.50), tails intact, are fanned along their curves; they're quite juicy, and terrific dipped into a little dish of salt spiked with hot pepper.\nShangri-La is a little like visiting Chinatown. The lights are too bright, and the 40-seat place always boasts a full house, especially on weekends for dim sum, and even early on weeknights.

Elounda enjoys a great location on Crete\u2019s north coast. Resorts in this region can have slightly lower temperatures than those in the south because of the cooling northerly winds which can reach this part of the island.\nThe weather in Elounda in September produces an average of just 10mm of rain across just two rain-affected days. Temperatures reach an amazing daytime average high of 27\u00b0C and only drop to around 19\u00b0C on rare colder days. Sunbathers will love the 12 hours of sunshine in Elounda in September. With the sun up until 7.45pm at the start of the month, there\u2019s plenty of time to relax at the beach or by your pool. The winds are calm at just 9mph on average but the UV level is quite high, so take care in the late summer sun and use plenty of sunblock.\nCould you suggest some activities that are suitable for this time of the year in Elounda?",

The trees had all been replaced and the buildings had been transformed. We were under the watchful eye of a new breed of creatures. They moved like robots and did the bidding of invisible forces. \n\nWe soon realized that our world was now controlled by a machine intelligence. It had taken over everything from our government to our economy and now it was dictating our lives. We were no longer in charge of our own destinies, or even our own fate.

Do you want a whole new direction for the marketing strategy? If that is the situation, publishing videos on the web may be the perfect solution to your problems? Posting online videos will help you attract another generation of clients, which can cause more sales. Look at the below article for advice on how to achieve this.\nIn relation to online video marketing, creating the video is only half the battle. For instance, you will need to advertise your videos. Should you advertise your video, you\u2019ll find you receive much more viewers than otherwise. You could have probably the most brilliant video on the web, but people should know it is actually there!\nEmploying a team to create your videos is a means to ensure success. You do not necessarily should involve colleagues, as you might choose that friends, loved ones or other acquaintances are very-suited to the task. Credit them close to the end in order to see their names.\nOmit any information that is certainly off-topic or otherwise important. Without preparation, it\u2019s very easy to actually stray off topic. Try creating a simple outline of what you wish your video being about and keep on it while filming. Don\u2019t stray from your message in order to guarantee an effective video marketing campaign.\nBe certain the page the recording is on also has an opt-in selection for your mailing list. Your viewers may wish to sign your subscriber list in order to receive additional information on your own video topic. It is an ideal time to apply your sales pitch.\nAlways take along a video camera along with you. It is possible to talk to an authority or maybe show how your experience went. If you do a public talk, don\u2019t forget to ask anyone to record that for you.\nOnce you develop a video, ask the viewers for taking an action. This is exactly what is known as a \u201ccall to action\u201d. For example, if you\u2019d like your viewers to sign up to a newsletter, request they click the link provided inside the description from the video. They answer to this working is so it will be simple to your viewers.\nEnsure you also have fresh, exciting content available so viewers come back often. Boring content just makes people angry. You wish to maintain your viewers interested and curious about whatever you might post next. In case your content is intriguing and engaging, then you are much more likely to draw in viewers and potential prospects.\nOnline videos are becoming popular currently, so utilize them to your benefit to help boost your marketing efforts. Individuals who use marketing with video is certain to get ahead in the marketplace. The suggestions you may have just read should help you in the process.. Based on the passage above, How can you ensure that your videos reach a wider audience, and what role does advertising play in this process?",

During my Ph.D. research I investigated the pathogens and environmental factors influencing Japanese beetle populations in the state. The prevalence of various pathogens and parasitoids attacking Popillia japonica were recorded annually from wild populations. Of specific interest was the microsporidian pathogen Ovavesicula popilliae, which I introduced as a biological control agent in the state. Details of the relationship between this pathogen and the Japanese beetle were investigated, including dose response, host range, and spore production. Additionally, annual abundance of the beetle in the region was recorded and tracked over the course of 4 years using soil sampling for larvae and pheromone traps for adults. Outdoor and indoor rearing methods were developed, and the density of these populations were recorded and compared to wild populations and temperature data, allowing us to model climate impact on the beetle.\nResults from these studies showed that, naturally occurring pathogens, such as Stictospora villani, Ovavesicula popilliae and Adelina sp., and parasitoids appeared to have minimal influence on the beetle populations in this region. In the case of O. popilliae, low levels of the pathogen appeared in the area naturally. This pathogen also has a narrow physiological host range outside of the Japanese beetle, primarily in other scarab larvae. O. popilliae also appears to primarily infect Japanese beetle larvae and was incapable of infecting adult beetles. Infected larvae which survived to adulthood remained infected, with the adults capable of producing on average 25 million spores. In comparison, high summer temperatures and lack of rain reduced late summer populations of larvae.\nIn 2010, O. popilliae was released at four locations in Northwest Arkansas. In 2011 it was detected at one of those locations. A second introduction of O. popilliae was made in 2012. The results from this classical biological control effort involving the release of O. popilliae require further monitoring to confirm establishment. This information can be used to help establish long term control of this new pest in the Southern United States. This information will be of use to fruit growers, horticulturalists, turf managers, nursery operators, and homeowners.\nPetty, Bryan Mathew, \"Abiotic and Biotic Factors Affecting the Japanese Beetle in Arkansas\" (2013).

The issue and interview are released one week prior to the January 6, 2018, premiere of the Lifetime original movie A Tale of Two Coreys.\nThe movie focuses on the lives of Corey Feldman and Corey Haim, two teen idols whose star shone brightly in the 80s with a series of iconic films, while their personal lives were embroiled in drugs, sexual abuse, and reckless behavior. The movie is not sanctioned by Corey Haim\u2019s family and they were not involved in its production. Instead, past interviews with Corey Haim were used to compile his character, according to Feldman.\nCorey Feldman served as executive producer and oversaw the script to make sure it was close to the truth. Though he participated, he stated to People that Lifetime could not tell the full story and A Tale of Two Coreys is essentially a G-rated version of an X-rated story.\nA Tale of Two Coreys delves into the alleged sexual abuse that both Corey Haim and Corey Feldman experienced. It\u2019s unclear at this point how much detail will be revealed and how closely the movie will parallel Feldman\u2019s memoir Coreyography that debuted on the New York Times\u2019 Bestseller\u2019s List.\nFeldman ran a Truth Campaign from October 24-December 24 to raise money to turn Coreyography into a full motion picture. As Feldman said to People, Lifetime could only go so far in their story.\nFeldman addressed these issues in the Truth Campaign as part of the reason he launched the fundraiser in order to raise funds for his movie.\nBecause A Tale of Two Coreys covers the childhood and adult lives of Corey Feldman and Corey Haim, two actors portray each role.\nCorey Feldman is portrayed by Elijah Marcano and Scott Bosely and Corey Haim is played by Justin Ellings and Casey Leach.\nAre you going to watch A Tale of Two Coreys?",

        "instruction": "Can you summarize the key takeaways from attending the On24 and Demandbase martech user conferences in San Francisco? Answer according to: Those wise words were ringing in my ears as I attended not one but two martech user conferences over three consecutive days in San Francisco earlier this month. Both On24 and Demandbase are seeking to build their own movements \u2013 and increasingly succeeding, it would seem.\nI\u2019m now a veteran of On24\u2019s courageous Webinar World event, having attended the first such shindig back in 2017 in San Francisco, and then at both the London offshoots. I blogged about my experience at the inaugural event, confessing my not-inconsiderable scepticism that it would be genuinely possible find enough good content to fill a two-day conference on webinars\u2026 and how happy I was to be proven so significantly wrong.\nMy expectations for 2019 were more of what I had seen two years ago, and in London in between. In this, I wasn\u2019t disappointed: Webinar World 2019 San Francisco was kicked off by the dynamic duo of CMO Joe Hyland and (cult leader) Mark Bornstein, with their trademark quick-fire banter and pitch-perfect scene-setting. They were followed by a mix of high level keynotes from the likes of Matt Heinz, plus a raft of great case studies-come-testimonies from enthusiastic users in the field.\nWebinar World had all this, but it also had a much more tangible sense of ambition, purpose and vision than I'd seen before. As founder Sharat Sharan set out in his afternoon keynote, On24 is making a bid to own the engagement space in B2B. He unveiled a suite of enhancements to its webinar platforms (plus a new partnership with Marketo) which has the potential to transform market perceptions from being one of many webinar vendors in a relatively commoditised tech category, to an innovative, forward-thinking and (above all) cornerstone B2B martech platform, which can shape the success of both the brands and marketers that use it. This bid is both strong and compelling.\nThe turbo-charged clear sense of purpose, strong culture and leadership team, overlaid on the \u2018#webinerd\u2019 ironic tagline which it has so successfully coined and cultivated everywhere and anywhere, is a heady and potent mix. On24 deserves to succeed and take its business to the next level, and I\u2019m quite sure it will.\nDemandbase, meanwhile, is riding the crest of the wave of excitement around ABM which shows no sign of abating, and which defined the tone and atmosphere at its ABM Innovation Summit which took place just down the Embarcadero at Pier 27. Unlike On24, Demandbase is not having to redefine expectations or ironically address perceptions, It can be and is much more bullish.\nThere was a real swagger about this event. CMO Peter Isaacson and CEO Chris Golec are strong and slick stage performers, and they had the gall to make their follow up \u2018act\u2019 on the keynote stage body language expert Mark Bowden, rather than a marketer (who for my money was the separated-at-birth identical twin of Rik Mayall of TV's Bottom and The Young Ones \u2013 an anarchic, flamboyant persona with a British accent to boot). No need for industry analysts to reinforce your relevance or value here. Get the laughs in first, and the tactical breakouts can follow later.\nDemandbase is the posterchild of the fast-growing ABM tech scene, and the success of its flagship event in many ways defines or is symptomatic of the success of the category as a whole. On this showing, with attendance figures claimed to be in excess of 1000, ABM-tech in rude health, and the ABM Innovation Summit looks set to follow on the likes of Marketo\u2019s Marketing Nation event as a mainstay of B2B marketing calendar \u2013 for its clients, if not the wider market.\nSo, how do these events stack up when in terms of building a martech movement?\nDo they have charismatic frontmen? Check.\nGreat content and high profile speakers? Check.\nA wildly enthusiastic audience? Check (this is America, remember. There was whooping).\nAfter hours partying? I am reliably informed this happened at both events, although jetlag precluded me from participating.\nWhat other ingredients do you need? Perhaps the final item on the recipe is an ecosystem of aligned and engaged tech partners. Both events had this, and I don\u2019t think you can overstate their importance in providing validation and wider context for the host vendor. But they also served to reinforce the sense of San Francisco and the wider area as a distinct ecosystem, which is at least partly separate from the wider B2B world in the US. The vendors support and work with one another, often in the spirit of 'co-ompetion' (a mix of collaboration and competition, where appropriate) and the success of the flagbearers drives the sector collectively onwards.\nI wrote this blog at the end of my trip, sitting on the plane as we waited to take off from San Francisco International Airport. I learned an awful lot from three packed days in San Francisco \u2013 not just from my time at these events, but also associated meetings and conversations with various other vendors, clients and agencies. The martech scene around the Bay Area is truly fascinating and is a phenomena of our time \u2013 vendor events such as these provide a snapshot of what it's like to work within it, and the energy (not to say the hype) driving it.",
