Jacque Pregont, president of the Atchison Area Chamber of Commerce greeted us at the Atchison Visitor Information Center in the historic Santa Fe Depot. The Visitor\u2019s Center is a great place to start your tour of Atchison, because the gift store offers an array of fun gift items as well as books and guides on what Atchison residents proudly call the \u201cMost Haunted Town in Kansas.\u201d If you ask, the locals will share endless stories of ghostly encounters about the town. And from now through Halloween, trolley tours will take visitors on hosted adventures throughout the town\u2019s Victorian homes and cemeteries.\nWe were eager to check in at the Tuck U Inn Bed and Breakfast located in the historic Glick Mansion. This incredible home set high on a hill was built by George Glick, who was elected governor of Kansas in 1882, and features lovely period antiques, large porches, sunrooms for relaxation and stately bedrooms.We particularly enjoyed visiting with innkeepers Loman and Chris Wildy, who told us great stories about Atchison and pointed out several areas of interest. We felt right at home and had a delightful breakfast the next morning with another couple we met during our stay. I\u2019m not sure if it was the nice company, the beautiful setting or the fresh food, but my husband and I easily agreed that our delicious morning meal was one of the top five breakfasts we\u2019ve ever had! Other great Atchison experiences included an evening meal at the River House Restaurant overlooking the river and hearing fun ghost stories of the building\u2019s past as a brothel. Take time after leaving the restaurant to walk across the street for a view of the river and the Lewis and Clark Pavilion and the Veteran\u2019s Memorial Plaza.\nWe also enjoyed Snow Ball Ice Cream & Candy Shoppe, an old-fashioned ice cream store with cute gifts, including a sock monkey that we bought for our 7-year-old son. Speaking of shopping, Nell Hill\u2019s is really an amazing store with national fame. If you love decorating, HGTV and the holidays, this store is a must-stop on your shopping trip in Northeast Kansas. Take plenty of time to browse the shop \u2013 it\u2019s rich with surprises and surrounded by many other stores along a walking pavilion on Commercial Street.\nNext, we cruised down the beautiful Glacial Hills Scenic Byway to Leavenworth. We enjoyed seeing the Buffalo Soldier Monument at Fort Leavenworth, the oldest continuously operating fort this side of the Mississippi River and an area rich with history. Last year, the Buffalo Soldiers were named one of the 8 Wonders of Kansas People. Perched in a beautiful park, the monument commemorates the 9th and 10th Calvary Regiments comprised of black soldiers who fought bravely during the Indian Wars. Cheyenne warriors named them \u201cBuffalo Soldiers\u201d as a tribute to their courage.\nWe completed our tour of Leavenworth with lunch at the Corner Pharmacy. We sat at the counter and watched the cooks grill up our hamburgers and onion rings, and had a super time joking with the friendly staff. Leavenworth CVB Director Connie Hachenberg stopped by to tell us about all the additional shopping and eating establishments in Leavenworth \u2013 and it quickly became clear that we need another day to just shop in Leavenworth.\nMy husband and I found Atchison and Leavenworth to be filled with beautiful architecture, rich history, eclectic shops and friendly faces. And, with a gorgeous byway connecting the towns, visiting both towns makes for a great weekend getaway in Kansas!\nChelle Decker works for jones huyett Partners in Topeka. As an Account Manager she works with the Kansas Travel and Tourism Divison to promote travel in the state of Kansas. She is a native of Olathe, Kansas, lived in Emporia for three years, and now calls Topeka her home.

However, the chances of you being a jack-of-all-trades in business is slim to none. Teaching yourself website design or SEO can take weeks and upwards of months, and even then, some mistakes could slip under the radar. After all, you aren\u2019t a professional.

The survey also cites continued concerns about an Iranian nuclear crisis and a major military incident involving China and the United States or one of its Pacific allies.\nEach year, CFR\u2019s Center for Preventive Action (CPA) asks more than fifteen hundred government officials, academics, and experts to evaluate a list of thirty conflicts that could break out or escalate in the next twelve months. CPA categorizes the contingencies into three tiers, in order of their relative priority to U.S. policymakers.\n\"There are many potential sources of conflict around the world, but not all are equally likely or consequential to U.S. interests. American policymakers, therefore, have to make choices about where to focus their preventive efforts, and this survey aims to help,\" says Paul B. Stares, CPA director and General John W. Vessey senior fellow for conflict prevention.\nCompared to last year\u2019s survey, two contingencies were upgraded to high priority: a major erosion of security in Afghanistan and the intensification of Syria\u2019s civil war. Three high-priority contingencies were downgraded to mid-level: a U.S.-Pakistan military confrontation, triggered by a terror attack or U.S. counterterror operations; a significant increase in drug trafficking violence in Mexico; and continuing political instability in Libya. Political instability in Saudi Arabia was downgraded from high to low priority.\nOther contingencies appeared on the list for the first time, including the failure of a multilateral intervention in Mali and the potential boiling over of popular discontent in Jordan.\nTo read the complete 2013 survey and the previous years\u2019, visit: www.cfr.org/preventive_priorities_survey.Watch an interview with Stares explaining the survey\u2019s results and read his Expert Brief outlining ways in which the United States can prevent the use of chemical weapons in Syria.

        "instruction": "How can companies engage with customers and build a loyal following on social media? Generate according to: Everybody uses social media, there\u2019s no avoiding it. It\u2019s our number one place to stay connected to friends, family, colleagues, news, and, most importantly to marketers, companies and brands. There are now more than 2.3 billion active social media users, which makes social media an unavoidable part of your marketing strategy. Unlike the past where marketers blindly advertised and hoped for the best, social media provides your company the opportunity to engage with customers in real time. Customer complaint? You can solve it. Positive customer review? You can thank the user and offer a gift or promotion. Simply being there isn\u2019t enough. Your company needs to engage and interact to grow a loyal following. The most important aspect of any social media marketing strategy is to set S.M.A.R.T. (Specific, Measureable, Achievable, Realistic, and Timely) goals. Posting blindly and expecting to achieve massive amounts of new sales would be like cooking without the right ingredients and expecting perfection. By setting goals before you begin, it\u2019s easier to measure success or failure. These goals aren\u2019t always focused on money or return on investment, and they shouldn\u2019t be. Social media marketing is more about engagement and providing solutions to problems rather than selling. Gain 1,000 Twitter followers by the end of the month. Gain 10 5-Star Reviews on Google in three months. For instance, as the amount of photos of food increases on social media, restaurants are offering promotions and discounts for those that post pictures of their food on social media. That provides the restaurant with exposure and the customer feels connected. Achieve 10 mentions a week on Twitter within three months. Engage 10 customers a month on various social media channels about problems for three months. If you\u2019re not leveraging social media to acquire leads and generate sales, you\u2019re not using social media properly. This is what most companies strive for first, but fail to realize that without time spent on the first four goals, it\u2019s unlikely that sales will grow. Social media provides the perfect opportunity to interact with potential customers, both on a personal level and an organizational level, to gauge their pain points, and to understand their basic corporate culture. This knowledge allows for a warm call when you first engage, as opposed to a cold call. Average 5% Click Through Rate on Tweets by end of year. Social media marketing is a multi-faceted approach that, when used properly, can help grow your business by creating brand awareness, engaging with customers, and finding new customers. It is, however, impossible to be everywhere, which is why you need to find the social media channels that are right for your company and your brand. For instance, 90% of Instagram users are younger than 35. But even if that\u2019s your target market, it still doesn\u2019t mean Instagram is the right channel for your brand. Your organization needs to set S.M.A.R.T. goals so successes and failures can be measured properly. More often than not, especially in the beginning, it is better to focus on engagement and building a presence. If you jump right into selling, you may lose traction before getting started. Use your knowledge and expertise to provide solutions to problems, and you will present your company as a trusted advisor that people want to buy from.

In 1551 twelve others arrived, and established a house, which they used for 22 years.\nThe location of the property was unhealthy, with moist soil and contaminated water. The present Church and Convento of Saint Augustine were begun in 1574, on the intersection of Jir\u00f3n Ica and Jir\u00f3n Caman\u00e1 in central Lima. Officially, the church was dedicated to Our Lady of Grace, (La Iglesia de Ntra. Sra. de Gracia).\nThe church was a changing work of art. A tower was added in 1637, later damaged by an earthquake, and pulled down when the church (except for the facade mentioned below) was generally demolished and rebuilt between 1903 and 1908. It was of modern style with gothic elements. Provision was made for symmetrical towers, which were never built. This makes the famous stone section of the fa\u00e7ade look like it is being pressed between two large bookends.\nThe well-known fa\u00e7ade was begun late in the seventeenth century, and finished in 1720. It is of stone. It is profusely carved with adornments in the churrigueresco baroque style. Occupying pride of place in the fa\u00e7ade is Saint Augustine, with angels at his side. Other parts of the fa\u00e7ade depict Popes, and saints of the Order of Saint Augustine. Supplementary decoration is the carving of wreaths, leaves, flowers and fruits. The fourth level was re-formed in 1908, not in stone but of similar style in cement.\nThe central cloister (clausura, patio) of the monastery (convento) has majestic arches on the ground level and on a second storey. The upper level was adorned with thirty eight pictures of the life and works of San Agust\u00edn. These were painted by the artist, Basilio Pacheco, in the middle of the eighteenth century. He included his own image in one of the paintings. In the central garden of the cloister is a work of art in bronze, produced by Pedro Mej\u00eda in 1765.\nFa\u00e7ade of San Agustin Church, Lima, Peru.

A few minutes later, the data is processed in Leica Cyclone REGISTER software. The stope is then modeled within seconds in 3DReshaper.\nWith laser scanning, a time savings of up to 7 hours, compared to previous traditional surveying techniques, is achieved. Whereas processing a stope survey previously could take up to 8 hours, the mine technicians can now extract it under 1 hour using Cyclone, 3DReshaper and other Leica Geosystems software solutions.\nMore importantly, though, this technology enables the mine to reach its top priority \u2013 safety.\nIn underground mining, safety is a top requirement. Knowing the environment around you is fundamental for ultimate security and extraction planning.

Answer according to: I started reading Summer of Sloane while out running errands when I needed something to pass the time. I had no intention of being sucked into this read, but that was exactly what happened and I was left wishing I had read this book sooner.\nI was hooked from the beginning. The book starts with Sloane finding out that her best friend is pregnant with Sloane\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s baby. When the boyfriend tries to confront Sloane, she punches him in the face, which breaks both his nose and her hand. Her life in shambles, Sloane and her twin brother, Penn, jet off to spend the summer in Hawaii with their mom and step dad. There she reconnects with old friends as well as makes new ones, but the drama she left back in Seattle isn\u2019t going away anytime soon and Sloane will have to face it sooner or later.\nI loved Sloane the moment she punched Tyler in the face. The guy needed it, and I\u2019m so glad that that was her reaction. Losing your best friend and your boyfriend (two people you\u2019ve known for practically your entire life) in one fell swoop is no easy matter, and my heart broke for Sloane. I thought that her actions and decisions she made throughout the book were very justifiable \u2014 she was the one who was betrayed, so she is the one who gets to feel hurt.\nErin L. Schneider\u2019s writing is addictive, and I couldn\u2019t help but fly through Summer of Sloane \u2014 I just didn\u2019t want to put the book down! I loved the tropical Hawaiian setting, main plot, and all the minor characters. The drama kept me engaged, but a couple misunderstandings toward the end frustrated me. However, I did love the ending where Sloane finally learned to make decisions for herself.\nOverall, I really enjoyed Summer of Sloane and I look forward to reading Erin L. Schneider\u2019s next book. I highly recommend Summer of Sloane to contemporary lovers looking for a great read filled with summer vibes.",

The team led by the Maryland researcher Bruce Yu, a professor in the department of pharmaceutical sciences, will collaborate with researchers at ChromaTan Corp, a Pennsylvania-based biotechnology company.\nYu plans to develop technologies that will allow the analysis of pharmaceuticals during manufacturing without being potentially destructive. Officials in the department say Yu\u2019s research is breaking new ground in drug manufacturing and the grant will allow the promising research to continue.\nThe problem with traditional manufacturing of biopharmaceuticals, which include vaccines and emerging drugs for cell and gene therapies, is that they are made with living cells and can be complex to manufacture on a large scale, Yu said. The drug makers often have to manipulate drug samples to measure their quality and performance along the way.\nYu\u2019s research could lead to a so-called process analytical technology that would not require manipulation or removal from the production line. That could not only improve quality but reduce costs.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: How could Yu's research reduce costs in the manufacturing process?",

        "instruction": "Here is a piece of text: A recent survey indicates that health care has made little progress toward value-based care (VBC) since last year, with more than two-thirds (67 percent) of physicians and health plan executives indicating that U.S. health care is still predominantly a fee-for-service system.\nThe findings come at the same time that the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has announced a slew of proposals that have, among other things, reduced the amount of total incentives available for redistribution to eligible physicians who meet quality thresholds under the Merit-Based Incentive Systems Program (MIPS) for Medicare beneficiaries.\nAccording to Dr. L Patrick James, Chief Clinical Officer of Quest Diagnostics, who conducted the survey, a majority of physicians believe they do not have the tools or the data to succeed in a value-based contracting environment.\nThe slowdown in the shift towards value-based care has several ramifications.\nMany of the components of value-based care, namely data and analytics, remote monitoring, enhanced patient engagement and improved caregiver communications are all part of the ongoing digital transformation of health care. Investing in these programs continues to make economic sense only when there is money to be made doing so, and cease to have any meaning when the system of incentives diminishes the monetary benefits of these programs.\nWith the stalling of the shift to value-based care, health systems are likely feeling the impact of margin compression as reimbursements under the traditional fee-for-service model continue to fall. Discretionary dollars are more likely to go towards maintaining and upgrading essential infrastructure, and in optimizing existing IT investments. The appetite for big-ticket technology investments, especially for digital initiatives, is likely to be low, except for targeted investments with clearly identifiable returns on investment.\nIt\u2019s safe to say that the debate on health care\u2019s future in data has been put to rest. However, as indicated by the Quest survey, it appears that physicians are overwhelmed by the flood of data, and making the data actionable is a crucial challenge today. Poor data, along with a lack of adequate tools, impact the ability of physicians to qualify for incentives under the MIPS scheme, forcing them to stay with fee-for-service payment models even in an era of declining reimbursements.\nAcross industries, there is more downbeat news on digital transformation. A recent study by consulting firm Capgemini and the MIT Center for Digital Business concludes that organizations are struggling to convert their digital investments into business successes. The reasons are illuminating and many: lack of digital leadership skills, and a lack of alignment between IT and business, to name a couple. The study goes on to suggest that companies have underestimated the challenge of digital transformation and that organizations have done a poor job of engaging employees across the enterprise in the digital transformation journey.\nThese findings may sound surprising to technology vendors, all of whom have gone \u201cdigital\u201d in anticipation of big rewards from the digital bonanza (at least one global consulting firm has gone so far as to tie senior executive compensation to \u201cdigital\u201d revenues). Anecdotally, \u201cdigital\u201d revenues are still under 30 percent of total revenues for most technology firms, which further corroborates the findings of market studies on the state of digital transformation.\nDespite the somber survey findings, health systems continue to invest in initiatives that deliver tangible, near-term benefits. An example of a high priority investment area is patient access. At Providence St Joseph Medical system, a focus on online scheduling has delivered savings of $3 to 4 per appointment booked, producing over $300,000 in total savings to the health system. As a bonus, there are fewer no-shows when patients book online, which results in additional bottom-line benefits to the hospital. Since labor is around 60 percent of a hospital\u2019s costs, any digital solution that has a labor substitution component and increases productivity is a target for health system executives. The rising popularity of voice-enablement in caregiver communications is a case in point.\nWhich leads me to the title of this blog: is digital a game of small numbers? The point solutions referred to above seem to suggest that to be the case, at least as it relates to digital. Health care is no stranger to big numbers, considering the many millions each hospital has invested in implementing electronic health record (EHR) systems over the last decade. However, it seems unlikely that we will see such investment levels in digital, at least in the short term. Part of the reason is that there no single, monolithic digital platform that can perform the tasks at the scale and scope of a foundational transaction system like EHR. The digital health solution provider market is highly fragmented, and there is a shortage of ready-to-deploy \u201clast mile solutions\u201d which I have discussed in an earlier column here.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: What are some of the ramifications of the slowdown in the shift towards value-based care?",

It focuses on results, evaluating the effectiveness and suitability of controls by challenging underlying rules, procedures and methods. Management audits, which are generally performed internally, are compliance audits plus cause-and-effect analysis.\nManagement audit requires some additional work. It is a systematic technique of evaluating the operation and effectiveness of the management of a firm.\nThis audit is conducted by an independent auditor or auditing firm, who are experts in auditing. This is done yearly or periodically. The audit team collects as many facts and information from office records and personal interviews with the personnel of the firm. The team also collects data through questionnaires distributed among the personnel and customers and/or clients of the firm. The team shall submit recommendations to the management for future actions.\nManagement may use these recommendations for controlling the performance and accomplishments of the firm. According to Ferlyn L. Suvillaga \u201cit is a systematic assessment of methods and policies of an organization\u2019s management in the administration and the use of resources and other more. \u201d From the response of Loria Lyn M. Fernandez \u201cmanagement audit is audit itself but instead of in accounts, it deals with the management. As explained by Rancy Mendoza \u201cit is the process of determining the individual or group performance in an organization or business. \u201d Based on the statement of Ivey Anne Muncada \u201cit is a systematic assessment of company\u2019s organizational policies and administration. \u201d After reading a very reliable references, the researcher finally realized that management audit is very important, whether to organization, company or firm.

        "instruction": "Can you summarize the recent study on the dynamics of classical and quantum models, specifically regarding ring geometry and the behavior of classical and quantum particles in disordered environments?\nGenerate according to: Our recent study considers the dynamics of classical and quantum models, in particular ring geometry: (a) with classical particles that perform random walk in disordered environment; (b) with quantum Bose particles whose dynamics is coherent.\nDetails on (a): it is possible to induce non-equilibrium steady state current, which requires e.g. a radiation source. One question that has been addressed concerns the relaxation of such current, and how it depends on percolation and localization properties of the model.\nDetails on (b): there is a possibility to have a super-current that does not decay even in the absence of an external driving source. This is known as super-fluidity. The study provides a theory for the meta-stability of such flow-states. A central observation is that the analysis should take into account the chaos that prevails in the classical limit of the model. It is the first time that the theory of \"chaos\" meets the theory of super-fluidity.\nBackground: Circuits with condensed bosons are the building blocks for quantum Atomtronics. Such circuits will be used as QUBITs (for quantum computation) or as SQUIDs (for sensing of acceleration or gravitation). We study the feasibility and the design considerations for devices where the atoms are confined to move in a several-site geometry (so called Bose-Hubbard system). For SQUID-geometry the sites form a ring with a weak link. Such ring can support super-flow (non-decaying persistent currents). If used as a QUBIT, the anti/clockwise flow-states can represent the digits \"0/1\". It is essential to realize that the full theory for the meta-stability of such flow-states, and for the feasibility of coherent operation, involves novel \"Quantum chaos\" considerations.\nAdiabatic processes are a fundamental family of physical processes, wherein a system is guided from an initial state to a target state via slow variation of control parameters. One such familiar protocol is known as 'Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage' (STIRAP); one application of STIRAP is to move atoms in space.\nThe concept of adiabaticity can be illustrated by considering the example of serving a teacup full-to-its-brim. In order not to spill any fluid, the process has to be carried out sufficiently slowly so as not to generate ripples. Using a more general physics vocabulary, the slowness of changing the control parameter (the teacup's position) should ensure there are no unwanted 'excitations' (ripples) which would lead to the loss of fluid.\nIn a new manuscript, published in Physical Review Letters, Prof. Amichay Vardi and Dr. Amit Dey from the Department of Chemistry, and Prof. Doron Cohen\u200b from the Department of Physics\u200b, explore what happens when adiabatic passage is carried out in many-body cold atom systems.\nThe researchers found that during its evolution, the system encounters brief chaotic intervals during which its behavior becomes erratic, a fact that had been ignored previously ignored. Due to these chaotic intervals, and in sharp contrast to our teacup example, adiabatic processes become inefficient if they are carried out too slowly, because the system has time to 'ergodize'.\nThus, according to the researchers, the optimal adiabatic passage rate, is determined by the the interplay of the standard demand to avoid single-particle excitations, and the need to quickly traverse the many-body chaotic stage.\nFigure: The dynamics of the system is illustrated in phase-space (an abstract space that accomodates all possible states of the systemI. The red cloud indicates how the evolving state of the system is stretched in phase-space due to chaos. Without chaos the red cloud would be locked at the center instead of being smeraed over the chaotic strip.",

        "instruction": "INDEPENDENCE, Ohio (AP) The Cavaliers\u2019 season is sliding toward serious danger, if it\u2019s not there already.\nGeneral manager Chris Grant just knows it needs to stop. Now.\nMaking a rare mid-season appearance before the media to address some of Cleveland\u2019s most pressing issues, Grant said he\u2019s troubled by the team\u2019s will in recent games.\nCleveland completed a 1-4 homestand with a 100-89 loss to New Orleans on Tuesday night. Following the poor performance, which came after an even worse one against Phoenix, Cavs coach Mike Brown questioned his team\u2019s motivation.\nPerhaps prompted by Brown\u2019s remarks, Grant made himself available to reporters during the season for the first time in more than three years for something other than to comment on a trade.\nGrant said there is plenty of blame to be shared for Cleveland\u2019s sorry state. The Cavs are just 16-29 and currently out of the playoff race in the weak Eastern Conference.\n\u201dWe\u2019re all accountable for it, including myself,\u201d Grant said. \u201dIt\u2019s frustrating. It\u2019s disappointing to our fans. The fans deserve better. That\u2019s hard, but we\u2019ve got a very experienced, creative dynamic group of people who are working on a daily basis to help us become more consistent. We know it\u2019s there. Our guys, they\u2019re learning, they\u2019re growing and we have expectations for them and for ourselves.\nOn Sunday, the Cavs scored just six points in the third quarter and blew a 20-point lead before losing to the Suns.\nThe back-to-back clunkers at home were in stark contrast to the team\u2019s play during a recent West Coast trip in which Cleveland went 3-2 and seemed to have found its groove. But the Cavs have fallen back on bad habits and Grant said it\u2019s imperative the club gets back to winning quickly.\nThe Cavs begin a three-game road trip in New York on Thursday. They\u2019ll also face Houston and Dallas before coming home.\nAfter Tuesday\u2019s loss, All-Star guard Kyrie Irving said he and his teammates believe in Brown, who has struggled trying to get his players to buy into his defensive-minded system.\nAlthough it\u2019s not showing in the form of wins, Grant thinks Brown has bonded with his players.\nOne positive Cavs on Tuesday was the performance by rookie Anthony Bennett, the No. 1 overall pick. He scored a season-high `15 points in 31 minutes. Grant has taken some heat for not sending Bennett to the D-League to work on his game, but it seems the team\u2019s patience could be paying off.\nCan you summarize the recent performance of the Cleveland Cavaliers and the concerns raised by Chris Grant?",

        "instruction": "Finding relevant sources from the library or the internet forms the most fundamental and most indispensable aspect of carrying out a study. Two major problems encountered when carrying out a study are: not knowing where to find relevant materials and how to retrieve them from the sources. A study consists of two major parts, that is; brainstorming and the study itself. The first step in locating sources requires one to know the kind of information he requires and the place where he can access the information. To develop an effective working bibliography requires one to be conversant with the library sources both in electronic and printed form and use of reference systems to find the sources. It is required that during the early phases of a study one should make sure he develops a tracking procedure that will ensure all bibliographic information from the sources is maintained (Markel, 2008).\nAlso constructing a list of experts for instance of well known author and lecturers in the area of study is significant in ensuring you get relevant and up to date information about the study one wants to carry out. These experts can be contacted for instance through oral interviews or through e-mails. A recommended search strategy requires one to consider how his topic of study progresses through research documentation lifecycle. One approach in this strategy requires one to look for reference sources that are currently accepted in the desired area of study and try to find out people (experts) who have cited them in recent years. This strategy will help one to develop a tree like network that will be vital in locating relevant research materials and in showing how works of others are interrelated (Markel, 2008).\nLocating and reading at least abstracts of papers will help one to classify the relevant papers by topic and the author's interest in the topic. This will help one to look for newer reference papers. This strategy is very important because different databases classify sources differently or can use different descriptors as key words (Markel, 2008).\nIn cases where one finds himself with too few sources because the topic is too narrow, he should try to find out terms or topic headings any newly found information was classified under. This will help one to employ those key words in other data base searches. If this fails to help one get enough sources for the study, he should seek help from the library personnel and experts in the field and find ways of expanding his topic in order to get more sources for the study (Weisberg, 2006).\nIf in the process of locating sources one finds too many of them, he should put down a strategy to cut down sources that he can manage. For instance one should emphasize taking journals that are specific in the area of study because they are considered as the best reference materials for carrying out any study. One can get experts' assistance on where to get important reference sources for the study. It is also required that one should classify the sources so that he has the best idea of the kind of information he wants. This will help one to retrieve only sources that are critical to the study and to avoid being overwhelmed by many materials that are interesting and related but not so critical to the study (Weisberg, 2006).\nAfter locating all relevant sources the final step involves synthesizing the information from the sources and summarizing it into a coherent literature for the study. This calls for accurate and critical analysis of information. This calls for skimming of articles and books to determine which sources are useful and in what context. Based on the passage above, Can you provide me with a recommended search strategy for locating relevant research materials for my study?",

As populations increase and resources become scarce, there is a danger that food waste could become an even bigger issue, leading to resource scarcity and an increase in global hunger. A large amount of food production in different countries is wasted due to inadequate storage and harvesting techniques, improper transport, and improper waste management. All of these factors contribute to the growing food waste problem, leading to increased food insecurity, resource depletion, and environmental destruction. \n\nApart from this, food waste is also leading to unsustainable farming practices and considerable losses in the supply chain. This is particularly worrying, as it accelerates the destruction of vital ecosystems and habitats, leading to decreased biodiversity and greater climate change. As such, it is essential that we take action to reduce food waste and shift towards more sustainable farming and food production practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***user task***:\nOops, belay that order.

The idea is also to use ingredients that are truly in season. In this case they are using the unique vegetable fiddlehead firms. Blossom's executive Chef Ramiro Ramirez says this is one of his favorite spring ingredients because they are only harvested for a few weeks. A bonus? They are a great source of vegan omega-3s.\nMince the 1/2 onion. Heat 2 tbs olive oil in a large saut\u00e9 pan and add the minced onion, saut\u00e9ing until soft and translucent, but not browning. Add the dry Arborio rice, and saut\u00e9 for 2-3 minutes. Add white wine, continue to stir. Add the water, and simmer on low heat until the water is absorbed. Set the risotto aside.\nBring 2 quarts of water to a boil. Blanche the peas for 30 seconds to 1 minute, then submerge in icewater for 30 seconds to stop the cooking process. Remove the peas from the icewater and place in a high-speed blender with the 1 cup water, spinach, lemon zest, and salt. Blend until smooth, then set aside.\nFinally, heat the vegan butter in a large saut\u00e9 pan. Add prepped vegetables to pan and saut\u00e9 on medium heat until beginning to brown. Set aside.\nTo finish the risotto, heat 1 tablespoons olive oil in a large saut\u00e9 pan on medium heat. Add the shallots and a splash of white wine, and saut\u00e9 for 1-2 minutes. Add the finished risotto and green pea sauce, and stir in pan until well-combined.\nPlate with risotto on the bottom, and top with the saut\u00e9ed fiddleheads, carrots, and fennel~!\nPer Serving: Calories: 743 | Carbs: 145 g | Fat: 14 g | Protein: 19 g | Sodium: 1920 mg | Sugar: 14 g\tNote: The information shown is based on available ingredients and preparation.

        "instruction": "Given the text: My reasons for doing so were simple: I wanted a new life. A life free of the thousand and one barriers and borders and definitions I'd created over the previous 40 years, all my stifling and suffocating notions of myself-that I was a decadent who didn't care about the health of my body. Or that I was a pacifist without an ounce of the desire to harm in me, or a coward whose avoidance of physical confrontation was actually evidence of his refinement. I was tired of being a decadent and a pacifist, devoted only to physical pleasure and irony and drinking and writing and the life of the mind. I was fulfilled and indulged and free of pain and strife and the need to protect myself or risk anything. Life was bliss, and I was bored to tears.\nAs advertised, learning to fight provided me all the transformation I could ever want. First there was the transformation of my body, which landed me in front of the mirror on more nights than I can remember. I gazed at my once-insignificant shoulders, which had turned round and taut, curving and dipping into thick lines between my biceps and triceps. My pectoral muscles shot upwards in a \"w\" from the bottom of my ribcage to my armpits. My chest, suddenly wide and imposing, sat perched atop a flat stomach on which, in certain lights and in certain moods, I swear I could make out my abdominal muscles.\nIf these two systems determine that danger is real, Drew says, the brain will focus all the bodys resources on struggle, flooding the bloodstream with adrenaline, pounding the heart to pump blood faster, releasing pain-deadening chemicals, and preparing the whole organism to protect itself. A balance between the amygdala and prefrontal cortex is needed to keep the host alive and free from unnecessary panic, to allow it to acknowledge fear without being swamped by it.\nThe thing is, the prefrontal cortex is painfully slow. Often, by the time the rational part of the brain realizes it's at risk, the amygdala has already triggered automatic responses in the body, and we find ourselves reacting instinctively to a threat rather than consciously, Drew says. So in order for the human body to respond in a more rational and concerted way to high-stress situations-like, say, an amateur cage fight in Long Island-motor routines have to become ingrained through repetition, rewiring the brains response to specific kinds of fear. Repeated enough times, these skills become ingrained in the brain, and knowledge and ability become subconscious: a new instinct.\nThis is one reason why soldiers and tightrope walkers and fighters train as much as they do. It's not just to learn techniques, but to habituate themselves to the conditions of high-stress, high-fear situations so that their primal instincts to panic are overridden by new motor routines. If the brain and the body are exposed enough times to a specific fear without harm, Drew says, the prefrontal cortex can learn to override the amygdala and its primordial panic when real danger finally comes.\nNorman Mailer once wrote that fighting arouses two of the deepest anxieties we contain. There is not only the fear of getting hurt, which is profound in more men than will admit to it, but there is the opposite panic, equally unadmitted, of hurting others.\" But theres a third anxiety Mailer failed to mention, maybe the worst of them all: the terror of discovering in the middle of a fight that you enjoy hurting others. It was this possibility that worried me: realizing, after all those peaceful, passive years, that I found pleasure, even meaning, in causing pain. My new fear was no longer that I would run away from violence, but that I would revel in it, that I would thrive on it.\nThis is the dark side of self-improvement and transformation, of that all-American push toward a better, purer, more perfect version of ourselves: discovering that the \"new you\" you've been dreaming about is actually a horrible beast, a cruel and sinister agent, the Hyde to your civilized Jekyll.\nTake the ancient amygdala. \"In response to the presence of excessive cortisol, amygdaloid neurons can branch out and grow more synapses,\" Drew says, \"enhancing the brains capacity for fear and aggression and other instinctual, defensive, and violent responses.\" So if fighters could be said to live in a perpetual state of fight-or-flight, a sort of low-grade chronic stress, its possible that theyre forever growing that primordial, unregulated, aggressive, fear-driven region of the brain we share with even the lowliest beasts of the jungle.\nWhich means, unlike other workout routines, fitness challenges, and self-improvement regimens, fighting brings with it the very real peril of unearthing parts of yourself that may be better left undiscovered-and the fear that, once roused, they can never be buried away again. A new life, a new you.\nThis story is adapted from the upcoming book Why We Fight: One Man's Search for Meaning Inside the Ring , by Josh Rosenblatt, available January 15.\nCan practicing specific motor routines help the brain respond more rationally in high-stress situations?",

        "instruction": "For decades, bariatric surgery has been one of the most effective long-term treatments for obesity. This has made bariatric surgery an increasingly popular procedure, with over 200,000 patients undergoing this surgery per year in the U.S. However, it is not without its risks. There have been conflicting reports on the effect of bariatric surgery on Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), including colitis and Crohn\u2019s disease, with some recent reports suggesting that bariatric surgery increases the risk of IBD.\nCVM researchers Dr. Bethany Cummings and Dr. Praveen Sethupathy \u201903 in the Department of Biomedical Sciences collaborated on a study that teases out the connections between bariatric surgery and IBD, recently publishing those findings in the journal \u201cObesity Surgery.\u201d Cummings has been developing and studying mouse models of bariatric surgery to understand the positive and negative effects of these surgeries for years. Sethupathy is an expert in gene regulation and microRNAs, particularly in the context of gastrointestinal health and disease. Therefore, they combined their expertise to gain clarity on the effect of bariatric surgery on IBD.\nVertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG), the most common type of bariatric surgery, increases bile acid concentration and the subsequent signaling of the bile-acid receptor TGR5. In previous mice studies, researchers found that an uptick in TGR5 signaling will protect mice against colitis. By this logic, VSG patients should have less incidence and worsening of colitis\u2014yet this isn\u2019t always the case.\nTo understand the interplay between VSG and TGR5 signaling, the Sethupathy and Cummings teams compared mouse models that had received VSG with those that underwent a sham surgery, while also comparing mice with and without the TRG5 receptors. Each of these groups were given chemically-induced colitis to determine how the disease progressed under each of these conditions.\nAs the researchers expected, the mice that had their TGR5 receptors genetically knocked-out suffered from worse colitis symptoms than the controls. More surprising, though, was the fact that VSG-treated mice with TGR5 receptors intact still suffered from colitis, despite the fact that those mice had higher bile acid signaling through the TGR5 receptors. \u201cOur data suggest that VSG worsens the severity of experimental colitis, which may explain the increased incidence of IBD development observed in human patients after bariatric surgery,\u201d says Cummings.\nThe researchers theorize that this may happen in part due to the dramatic alterations in gut microbe make-up after bariatric surgery. \u201cThe changes in the gut microbial composition after bariatric surgery are very similar to changes seen in human patients suffering from IBD,\u201d says Cummings. Another key player could be a specific microRNA known as miR-21. \u201cWe have shown previously that this microRNA is among the most aberrantly elevated in the colon of human patients with IBD,\u201d says Sethupathy. In this study, Cummings and Sethupathy have found that this microRNA is also significantly elevated after VSG in mice. They posit that post-operative increases in colonic miR-21 expression may promote tissue injury and the risk of colitis development. \u201cOther recent studies have linked miR-21 to the control of gut microbial composition, but whether that is relevant in the context of VSG remains to be seen,\u201d says Sethupathy.\nThe findings from this latest study provided the basis for a multi-PI NIH R01 grant application that Cummings and Sethupathy submitted last fall \u2014 if awarded, the grant would allow them to determine the precise mechanisms by which bariatric surgery promotes IBD. \u201cThe hope is that this research will allow us to develop prophylactic treatments for this rapidly expanding population of patients undergoing bariatric surgery to help prevent the development of IBD,\u201d says Cummings. Based on the passage above, What are the potential implications of the study's findings for the development of prophylactic treatments for IBD in patients undergoing bariatric surgery?",

Stephen Anderson is a Milwaukee poet whose work has appeared in numerous print and online publications and has been featured on the Milwaukee NPR affiliate radio station, WUWM. He is the author of a chapbook, The Silent Tango of Dreams (2006), and his poems have appeared more recently in the anthology, Portals And Piers (2012). As a Peace Corps volunteer, Stephen travelled extensively in South America; he also taught for a year at Queen Mary and Westfield College of the University of London, an arrangement that afforded him a chance to travel throughout Europe and the United Kingdom. As his wife is from Trinidad and Tobago, he has also visited those islands numerous times. Given his varied living experiences, including his childhood in Georgia and Tennessee, Stephen does not consider himself to be a \u201cregional writer\u201d in any way; instead, his poetry more aptly reflects what might be considered a global/universal perspective.

Over time, this leads to the development of new species which are better suited to the environment. Artificial selection, on the other hand, involves humans directly selecting which organisms are able to reproduce. Unlike natural selection, this is a conscious decision where humans selectively choose which organisms gain reproductive advantages. This is done in order to produce organisms with a desired trait or characteristic, such as larger fruits or better yields. Both natural and artificial selection are important processes that have allowed us to shape the world and its organisms as we know it.\n\n\nGenerate a date-focused sentence that uses comparative words and suits the input.june 1st is just around the corner.",

As they walked, they noticed that their glasses, which had become an integral part of their identity, were nowhere to be found. After a frantic search, they realized that their glasses must have dropped off somewhere in the dark rain. With no choice, the student began a journey, one that may lead them far, in hopes of finding their lost glasses. \n\nThe student trekked through dense forests, climbing up hills and braving treacherous rivers in search of something that now seemed so distant. Several days passed and their hope was starting to fade. But then, one fateful afternoon, their eyes caught a glimmer in the corner of their vision. They rushed towards the source, and to their surprise, it was their glasses. The student was overjoyed to find them, and they knew they would never be as careless with their glasses ever again. \n\nThe student thanked the storm for uniting them with their lost glasses, and continued on their journey, back home.",

While you may have plenty of quests already on your plate in Hidden Chronicles, if you scroll through your list long enough, you'll eventually find the four CoasterVille quests that will be available to complete in Hidden Chronicles for a limited time. We're here with a guide to get you started on these quests, so let's go!\nThe two Park Tickets are earned by posting a general news item to your wall. As for leveling up in CoasterVille, if you've already passed Level 5 in the game, you'll likely need to hit the button to head into CoasterVille from within Hidden Chronicles to make your progress sync. You'll receive 130 coins, 125 XP and two Target Hints for completing this quest.\nThe three scenes can be the same scene three times or three different scenes, so play scenes that you also need to complete other quests and finish two things at once. Finishing this second quest gives you two energy, 260 coins and 125 XP.\nSimply head your friends' Estates and click on the clock in the corner to play FastFind. Do this with two friends to finish this quest. You'll receive five Target Hints, some XP and coins for completing this third quest.\nTo hide packages, just visit friends and follow the prompts when you arrive. After you complete this final quest in the CoasterVille cross-promotion, you'll receive 900 coins, 325 XP and a Ferris Wheel for your Estate. The Ferris Wheel is worth 450 Estate Points, but it's also a pretty massive item. Still, it was free, so we can't complain.\nThese quests will only be available for eight days, so if you're having trouble increasing your level in CoasterVille, make sure to check out our cheats and tips guide, and add yourself to our Add Me page to make more progress with new friends! Good luck!\nHave you already reached Level 15 in CoasterVille, or are you just starting in Zynga's theme park game? Do you think you'll be able to complete these quests before they expire?

Regular exercise is known to have numerous physical health benefits, but its impact on mental health is not as well understood. This study aims to fill this gap in knowledge. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of the literature, analyzing studies that have investigated the relationship between regular exercise and mental health. We also conducted our own study, surveying a group of individuals who engage in regular exercise and a group who do not. We used a variety of measures to assess mental health, including self-report questionnaires and clinical interviews. Results: Our findings suggest that regular exercise significantly improves mental health. Individuals who engage in regular exercise reported lower levels of stress and anxiety, and higher levels of happiness and satisfaction with life. They also had lower rates of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety disorders. These findings were consistent across different types of exercise, including aerobic exercise, strength training, and yoga. Conclusions: Based on our results, we conclude that regular exercise has a positive impact on mental health. It can be an effective strategy for improving mental health and well-being. Future research should investigate the specific types of exercise that are most beneficial for mental health, as well as the optimal frequency and intensity of exercise. Citations: Smith, J. (2020).

According to Dan McLean, the notion of network performance is rising in importance for a lot of companies, but at the enterprise level, many companies are just struggling with simply getting a good handle on monitoring and managing their networks.\nMcLean added that network optimization is an expensive area in which to make investments, and cost is likely a deterrent for the average enterprise to take on such a venture.\nThe VNE Server from OPNET is available now and is priced at approximately US$90,000 per server.

        "instruction": "The aim of this chapter is to highlight the necessity of a change in perspective and a new approach to Retail Service Marketing by addressing the recent challenges posed by a radical rethinking of market exchange logic using a service view. Recent Service Marketing advances are analyzed, which lead to the Service Dominant Logic proposal to take a general service view of market exchange, envisaging an emerging paradigm change. However, the key to this potential paradigm change is not yet well focused. A gap in the theoretical approach emerges that can be closed by adopting the Viable Systems Approach and the structure-system interpretation scheme. Their implications for retailing are discussed, and the key to change is emphasized. This chapter introduces a new theoretical and conceptual framework rooted in systems thinking, which recommends a Service Systems Approach to Retail Marketing.\nService marketing on the one hand, and retail marketing on the other, have fueled a growing interest by scholars and practitioners in recent decades and given rise to relevant, worldwide research streams. Despite apparent theoretical and practical connections between the two areas of interest, little attention has been devoted to combining their respective theoretical advances. Conversely, with appropriate integration, as suggested by Bateson since 1985 and more recently, although implicitly, by Lusch, Vargo and O\u2019 Brien (2007), the two fields can gain significant benefits from one another.\nAccordingly, we focus on the inner \u201cservice\u201d nature of retailing and argue that a relevant contribution can emerge by integrating recent advances into the theoretical context of Service Marketing, with particular reference to the Service-Dominant Logic (SDL) proposal (Lusch & Vargo, 2006; Vargo & Lusch, 2006; 2008) and the wider view of Service Science (SS) (Maglio & Spohrer, 2008; Spohrer, Maglio, Bailey & Gruhl, 2007). With this aim, we discuss this possible theoretical integration by adopting the general perspective of the Viable Systems Approach (vSa) (Barile, 2000; 2008; 2009; Golinelli, 2000, 2010; Various Authors, 2011) as a methodological reference useful to highlight convergences and potential advances.\nThe evolutionary pathway traced by marketing theory in recent decades shows a series of changes in perspective that have led to a shift in focus from selling goods to establishing solid relationships with customers and, more recently, to developing a general service logic in the market exchange. This evolution has been theorized as leading from a Goods-Dominant Logic (GDL) to a Service-Dominant Logic (SDL) of market exchange (Lusch & Vargo, 2006). The key step in this evolution was first identified by the Relationship Marketing research stream (Gummesson, 2002), which understands the need to develop and maintain good relationships with customers both to build a solid basis for market exchange and to overcome transactional logic.\nInterpreted through the lens of the vSa, this evolution clearly reflects the need to overcome the traditional reductionist view of marketing, creating the basis for a new general theory of exchange. When focus is on goods, on products to manufacture, sell, distribute, deliver to customers, attention generally falls on their features (especially the physical ones) and is diverted away from the reason for which they are manufactured, sold, distributed, delivered, etc.: to serve the needs of people or organizations, solving their problems. Perspective needs to be changed by recovering the original \u201cservice\u201d purpose.\nIn this context, the need for a systems view capable of strengthening the understanding of emerging requirements of the current market scenario clearly reveals a research gap that must be closed (Barile, Pels, Polese & Saviano, 2012). By adopting the perspective of systems thinking, the traditional reductionist view still appears to dominate over the interpretative approach both in business research and in management. This is particularly true in the case of retailing, in which, despite relevant recent theoretical and practical advances, the traditional view, excessively focused on \u201cgoods to sell\u201d instead of \u201cservice to propose,\u201d still dominates in most cases. Although technically paid for offering a service, in actual fact, many retailers reveal to still play a mere operative role in making a manufacturers\u2019 products assortment accessible to consumers. This can be true even when many additional services are offered with the aim of enhancing the value delivered by retailers to customers.\nHow does the Viable Systems Approach help to integrate recent advances in Service Marketing into the context of Retail Marketing?",

TAROM assumes the formal membership mantle on Friday. From the four founding members, it has grown to more than 13,000 daily flights to 898 destinations in 169 countries, up from 6,402 daily flights to 451 destinations in 98 countries at its inception.\n\"As deregulation and Open Skies agreements opened opportunities for more effective business alignment, SkyTeam emerged as a way for airlines to offer customers more connections across the globe through alliances rather than complex intercontinental mergers. And our growth will continue,\u201d said SkyTeam Governing Board Chairman Leo van Wijk during yesterday\u2019s ceremonies. \u201cDuring the last 10 years, SkyTeam's experience with ground-breaking mergers and joint ventures has deepened the cooperation among our members, giving our customers access to more markets at lower fares. As we look back at SkyTeam's steady growth of members, all are focusing on creating global coverage by linking complementary networks, flying from a few of the best hubs in Europe, the US, Asia and Africa. Today we offer our customers more destinations, more frequencies and more and better connectivity.\"\nThe China Eastern Adherence Agreement signals the alliance\u2019s growth in Asia. \"Asia is a very important growth market for SkyTeam,\u201d said SkyTeam Managing Director Marie-Joseph Male, \u201cand we are well on track to strengthen our offering in this fast-growing part of the world. With our newest member Vietnam Airlines, and China Eastern joining us in the future, we will offer our customers 10% more daily flights than today. Combined with China Southern and Korean Air, these four Asian carriers will further strengthen SkyTeam's presence in Asia and position us for future growth. And we still intend to add more Asian carriers to our group, thus firmly consolidating SkyTeam as 'the' alliance for Asia.\" Garuda Indonesia is also pursuing SkyTeam membership.\nDuring its general meeting the CEOs from Delta, Air France and KLM signed a six-way joint venture protocol with the three carriers\u2019 pilots unions. The protocol recognises the importance of pilots in the success of the joint venture established in May-2009 and essentially ensures that the equitable distribution between the three members. In signing the agreement, the leaders committed to mutual understanding and information sharing between each other concerning all aspects of the agreement and recognize that the success of the Joint Venture will provide benefits and opportunities for all parties.\n\"This is a milestone agreement, and I believe it will serve as a template for future labour-management engagement in the industry's globalisation arena,\" said Captain Lee Moak, chair of the Delta Master Executive Council of the Air Line Pilots Association. \"Recent joint venture agreements at other properties have alienated labour by treating labour not as a partner, but as just another cost to be managed. In today's global marketplace, that is a formula for disaster. Instead, when the long-term interests of management and labour are aligned, it makes much more sense to engage through a professional working relationship for the benefit of all parties.\"\n\"As pilot labour, we view it as critically essential that no single corporation or pilot group benefits at the expense of the other, and this agreement helps to establish a level of mutual trust and cooperation between all parties to the agreement\" VNV President Captain Evert van Zwol explained. \"International joint ventures are the next step in our industry's evolution, and involving labor as a partner at the outset provides for a much greater probability of long-term success. We are pleased that the executives of KLM, Air France and Delta recognise this.\"\nIn addition to establishing a balance of flying between the carriers, the agreement calls for the corporations to provide their respective pilot unions with \"detailed historical and projected operating and financial information on the JV\" on a regular basis as well as periodic meetings \"to further develop relationships and to share information on the status, progress and future initiatives of the JV, in order to enhance the success of the JV.\"\n\"This agreement is built upon a cornerstone of collaboration rather than confrontation and on mutual benefit rather than antagonism\" said Air France ALPA President Captain Louis Jobard. \"Our airline executive teams understand that labour is an important asset in the Joint Venture. This Protocol Agreement helps to establish a strong and stable foundation for the Joint Venture moving forward, which is vitally important to its success.\"\nThe Joint Venture Protocol Agreement became effective at its signing and remains in effect concurrent with the Joint Venture agreement.",

Answer according to: Bitcoin [BTC] is at its most expensive level since its record highs in December 2017, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mike McGlone explains in an article published on April 5.\nThis week, the bitcoin\u2019s price hiked above $5,000 for the first time since November. A technical analysis tool, GTI Global Strength Indicator, a technical analysis tool showed it is the most expensive since December 2017 when bitcoin price nearly reached $20,000. Earlier also in the past the market witnessed multi-week downturns. According to CoinMarketFeed stats the bitcoin price climbed another 3 percent on last Friday.\nReport suggests that Bitcoin\u2019s GTI Global Strength Indicator shows that the coin has not been this expensive since its price broke its record value of $20,000. According to the reports from Bloomberg, similar patterns of multi-week downturns have been observed in the past as well.\nAccording to McGlone, the recent growth in the crypto market was triggered because of long-term price compression and low volatility that caused the price to be \u201creleased from the cage.\u201d McGlone expressed that he believes a similar downturn period will follow after the recent growth.\n\u201cNow it\u2019s a question of duration and I suspect when you have such a massive bubble, you\u2019ll always have an overhang of people who need to sell, \u201che further added.\n\u201cCertainly, an investor would much rather see a gradual rise with constant floors in terms of downside being established, as opposed to a very, very quick run-up. It could easily be easy come, easy go,\u201d he further added.\nTrader and author Peter Brandt seems to disagree with McGlone He tweeted on his official Twitter handle recently, he opinionated that the dominant cryptocurrency would soon enter another parabolic phase.\nMcGlone\u2019s and Tawil\u2019s opinion contradicts with Thomas Lee, co-founder and Global advisor of Fundstrat predictions. As CoinMark reported, according to Lee, Bitcoin is back in a bullish trend.

        "instruction": "When I signed up for Yoga Teacher Training in 2005, I wanted to deepen my practice and gain an understanding of the history and culture of yoga. Learning about the ancient yoga principles transformed my life on and off the mat. For me, yoga is about being human and about living in happiness, health and harmony. Yoga means \u201cunion.\u201d The aim is to create a balance between my mind, body, and spirit. I believe that children can begin to grasp this concept through activities that bring together their intellect, physical body, and relationships with those around them. My goal through my children\u2019s books is to have children reading, acting out the story, and having fun together \u2013 helping them balance their mind, body, and spirit. Yoga is a way of life. The yogic principles guide us in being productive, responsible, and engaged human beings. Yoga happens in everyday life, not just on my yoga mat. Children can learn about happiness, kindness, honesty, gratitude, passion, and self-esteem in their homes, classrooms, or yoga studios. An Indian sage named Patanjali put together a book called \u201cThe Yoga Sutras.\u201d Translated into English, this book contains the source of how to live a happy, healthy, and honest life. A book full of wisdom. We can absolutely share the translations of the sutras with children, through stories and situations they can relate to. For example, one of the sutras, \u201cIf you want to be happy, then you must be happy for others around you\u201d is the theme in one of my books, Anna and her Rainbow-Colored Yoga Mats. The physical postures (asanas in sanskrit) were inspired by the environment. People lived in mountains and created postures by watching and listening to their surroundings. Thus, we have Mountain Pose, Tree Pose, Downward Facing Dog Pose, and Child\u2019s Pose to name a few. Children can invent their own poses based on what they experience in the outdoors. Yoga is also about sitting still. The first yogis sat for long periods of time listening to their breath and the sounds of the forest. Meditation helps me to bring calm, focus, and relaxation to my life. It is as simple as 1) choosing a comfortable upright position, 2) committing to silence, and 3) focusing on our breath, positive affirmation, or chakra. While I wished that I meditated every day, the moments in the week that I do take to sit quietly are a real treat, especially being a new mom. Show your students or children how to sit quietly for a few moments. Try it, and see what happens. Yoga challenges me to focus on my breath. Practicing yoga helps me to breathe more deeply, not just the short breaths in my chest. The full yogic breath helps me to reduce stress and live in the present moment. You can teach children to focus on their breath by blowing feathers or cotton balls. They can place their hands on their belly to feel their bellies rise. This is a simple first step in helping children develop a healthy, life-long strategy for managing stress. Yoga reminds me to acknowledge my teachers. I am reminded by the yoga principles to acknowledge the lineage in whatever I\u2019m learning \u2013 that my knowledge is a compilation of my teachers\u2019 thoughts and wisdom. I feel blessed to have extraordinary mentors in my areas of passion \u2013 yoga (Katie Manitsas\u2019 books pictured below), motherhood, children\u2019s author, teaching, and traveling. It\u2019s a great practice for children to also learn to thank their life\u2019s teachers, to develop respect for the people in their life. Yoga helps me to develop acceptance. It\u2019s not about practicing the perfect yoga pose, or about never saying the wrong thing, or about meditating every single day. I must celebrate my \u201chuman-ness\u201d, be creative, and live the best way that I can. As a teacher or parent, we can also encourage children to accept themselves and others around them. Yoga is not just about the Downward Dog. The eight limbs of yoga offer us a pathway to happiness (or enlightenment) \u2013 ways to interact with ourselves, ways to interact with others, physical postures, breathing techniques, mindfulness, meditation, and ultimately offer a spiritual journey. As children get more comfortable in their bodies, they feel more confident in themselves and their relationship with the world. Join me for Part 2 of 3 where I\u2019ll ponder on: why should children practice yoga? Also check out my ebooklet Kids Yoga Stories: What is Yoga Discussion Book. How can children learn about the yogic principles in everyday life, outside of the yoga studio?",

Esval scored a personal-best mark of 13.950 to capture his first USAG title on the still rings, while Polen posted a career-high total of 13.900 to win the parallel bars and claim his first USAG medal.\nIn addition to their respective victories on the still rings and parallel bars, Esval and Polen claimed a second USAG All-America award on those same two events this afternoon at Macdonough Hall. Esval garnered a score of 13.200 to take fourth on the parallel bars, while Polen tallied a 13.050 to finish sixth on the rings.\nFellow sophomore Frankie Valentin earned USAG All-America honors on the pommel horse after scoring a 12.900 to tie for fourth and also accounted for a seventh-place finish on the vault (13.800).\nAir Force returns to action on Saturday, April 6, when it travels to Norman, Okla., to face the top-ranked Sooners, second-ranked Stanford and No. 11 California at the 2019 Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Championships.

        "instruction": "Here is a piece of text: Within Tomcat SSI support can be added when using Tomcat as your HTTP server and you require SSI support. Typically this is done during development when you don't want to run a web server like Apache.\nTomcat SSI support implements the same SSI directives as Apache. See the Apache Introduction to SSI for information on using SSI directives.\nSSI support is available as a servlet and as a filter. You should use one or the other to provide SSI support but not both.\nServlet based SSI support is implemented using the class org.apache.catalina.ssi.SSIServlet. Traditionally, this servlet is mapped to the URL pattern \"*.shtml\".\nBy default SSI support is disabled in Tomcat.\nCAUTION - SSI directives can be used to execute programs external to the Tomcat JVM. If you are using the Java SecurityManager this will bypass your security policy configuration in catalina.policy.\nTo use the SSI servlet, remove the XML comments from around the SSI servlet and servlet-mapping configuration in $CATALINA_BASE/conf/web.xml.\nTo use the SSI filter, remove the XML comments from around the SSI filter and filter-mapping configuration in $CATALINA_BASE/conf/web.xml.\nOnly Contexts which are marked as privileged may use SSI features (see the privileged property of the Context element).\nThere are several servlet init parameters which can be used to configure the behaviour of the SSI servlet.\nbuffered - Should output from this servlet be buffered? (0=false, 1=true) Default 0 (false).\nexpires - The number of seconds before a page with SSI directives will expire. Default behaviour is for all SSI directives to be evaluated for every request.\nisVirtualWebappRelative - Should \"virtual\" SSI directive paths be interpreted as relative to the context root, instead of the server root? (0=false, 1=true) Default 0 (false).\ninputEncoding - The encoding to be assumed for SSI resources if one cannot be determined from the resource itself. Default is the default platform encoding.\noutputEncoding - The encoding to be used for the result of the SSI processing. Default is UTF-8.\nallowExec - Is the exec command enabled? Default is false.\nThere are several filter init parameters which can be used to configure the behaviour of the SSI filter.\ncontentType - A regex pattern that must be matched before SSI processing is applied. When crafting your own pattern, don't forget that a mime content type may be followed by an optional character set in the form \"mime/type; charset=set\" that you must take into account. Default is \"text/x-server-parsed-html(;.*)?\".\necho - <!--#echo var=\"VARIABLE_NAME\" --> will be replaced by the value of the variable.\nexec - Used to run commands on the host system.\nflastmod - <!--#flastmod file=\"filename.shtml\" --> Returns the time that a file was lost modified.\nfsize - <!--#fsize file=\"filename.shtml\" --> Returns the size of a file.\nprintenv - <!--#printenv --> Returns the list of all the defined variables.\nset - <!--#set var=\"foo\" value=\"Bar\" --> is used to assign a value to a user-defind variable.\nApache Introduction to SSI for more information on using SSI directives.\nAUTH_TYPE The type of authentication used for this user: BASIC, FORM, etc.\nCONTENT_LENGTH The length of the data (in bytes or the number of characters) passed from a form.\nCONTENT_TYPE The MIME type of the query data, such as \"text/html\".\nGATEWAY_INTERFACE The revision of the Common Gateway Interface that the server uses if enabled: \"CGI/1.1\".\nHTTP_ACCEPT A list of the MIME types that the client can accept.\nHTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING A list of the compression types that the client can accept.\nHTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE A list of the languages that the client can accept.\nHTTP_CONNECTION The way that the connection from the client is being managed: \"Close\" or \"Keep-Alive\".\nHTTP_HOST The web site that the client requested.\nHTTP_REFERER The URL of the document that the client linked from.\nHTTP_USER_AGENT The browser the client is using to issue the request.\nPATH_INFO Extra path information passed to a servlet.\nPATH_TRANSLATED The translated version of the path given by the variable PATH_INFO.\nQUERY_STRING The query string that follows the \"?\" in the URL.\nQUERY_STRING_UNESCAPED Undecoded query string with all shell metacharacters escaped with \"\\\"\nREMOTE_ADDR The remote IP address of the user making the request.\nREMOTE_HOST The remote hostname of the user making the request.\nREMOTE_PORT The port number at remote IP address of the user making the request.\nREMOTE_USER The authenticated name of the user.\nREQUEST_METHOD The method with which the information request was issued: \"GET\", \"POST\" etc.\nREQUEST_URI The web page originally requested by the client.\nSCRIPT_FILENAME The location of the current web page on the server.\nSCRIPT_NAME The name of the web page.\nSERVER_ADDR The server's IP address.\nSERVER_NAME The server's hostname or IP address.\nSERVER_PORT The port on which the server received the request.\nSERVER_PROTOCOL The protocol used by the server.

        "instruction": "Can you provide examples of websites that are using diagonal corner layouts in their homepage design?: Making a good first impression is a vital part of website design. The homepage is often the first experience a user has with a business or organization and a striking design can help create interest. This month\u2019s trends all focus on homepage design elements that are just a little bit different than what users are used to seeing.\nFrom a purely aesthetic trend in shallow hero headers and diagonal corner layouts to a user interaction trend in this or that calls to action, there are plenty of interesting ways to draw the attention of users.\nFor a while the trend with hero images have been big, bold images and videos that fill the screen, often from the top of the homepage to right about where the scroll starts. More designs are starting to back off of this oversized image trend for shallower hero images.\nMuch of the design is still the same. Hero headers still include nice images or text with a configuration that\u2019s made to be looked at. But the images are about half as deep.\nWhat\u2019s nice about this concept is it helps move other information up on the screen. Body copy and calls to action that aren\u2019t in the hero image appear higher up in the design, giving users something to do or click right away. It can help prevent clutter in the image itself, which can be pretty important if the image is busy or hard to pair with text effectively.\nThis design pattern can also add more whitespace to the overall design, making it feel lighter and easier to navigate. With more minimal styles still popular, this concept might be one of the factors that\u2019s driving this design decision.\nThe toughest part of using a more shallow hero image is cropping. It\u2019s one of those things you\u2019ll want to think about early in the design process, all the way back to when you talk to the photographer about images. Because the shape is not as standard, you might need to explain how you plan to use the image to get a photo or video that will look good with that aspect ratio.\nSome trends are just too much fun to ignore. Diagonal corner layouts are one of those concepts.\nThese designs are exemplified by elements that are clustered in one corner of the screen \u2013 often the bottom right \u2013 and fan out onto the rest of the canvas. Elements are often positioned to look like they are bursting into the design.\nTo make the most of these elements, many designs \u201chide\u201d more elements below the scroll to add that extra element of reality so that parts of the design that you can\u2019t see feel tactile and exist on the scroll.\nWhile this type of design pattern doesn\u2019t work with every type of content, it can be a good idea for designs that don\u2019t have a lot of other art and use a lot of user interface elements to draw attention. It can also work for portfolio-style designs or serve as a way to organize many smaller visual elements into a single unit.\nMore designs are beginning to pop up with mirroring call to actions, that allow users to make a choice from the homepage as they decide what to do next. The design might look a number of ways, such as the direct would you cheat or not question from Words Hurt to the two-panel option from Stoli to the click-option navigation for the Hi Pointe Drive In.\nThe challenge here is that you need just the right kind of content for this design pattern to work. Some users can be overwhelmed by multiple choices and just want a single call to action with a single choice\u2014complete the action or not. Here, users have twice as many options to consider. To make the most of choices, the content has to be wholly engaging.\nThese design schemes rely a little more on planning content and design to match, knowing that you have a certain concept in mind. It takes preplanning and in some cases even requires a little HTML or CSS magic to pull it all together.",

Griner sat out following surgery to correct a retinal issue after she was hit in the right eye in Game 2.\nElena Delle Donne scored 23 points, Sylvia Fowles had 20 points and Allie Quigley had 19 for the Sky.\nTaurasi hit a tiebreaking short jumper and was fouled with 14.3 seconds left and she made the ensuing free throw to put Phoenix up 85-82.\nDelle Donne missed a 3-pointer with 12 seconds left, and the Sky fouled Penny Taylor, who made both free throws with 9.3 seconds left for the final score.\nTaurasi, who was 4 for 9 on 3s, scored 14 points in the fourth quarter and became the WNBA's all-time leading scorer in the finals. Phoenix, which had a WNBA-record 29 wins during the regular season, shot 49.3 percent overall from the field.\nGriner traveled to Chicago on Friday and shot around during pregame warm-ups. She said it was a doctor's decision to sit out.\n\"They wanted to make sure I was OK for the future, so I'm still day by day right now,\" she said.\nInstead of Griner, the Mercury started 6-foot-4 Ewelina Kobryn at center.\nPhoenix tied it at 67 in the fourth after three free throws. Jessica Breland was whistled for a technical after Bonner was fouled. Taylor made the technical free throw, and Bonner hit both of her foul shots before.\nTaurasi then made a 3 and a jumper to put the Mercury ahead 72-67.\nAfter the Sky cut the lead to two, Taurasi answered with a 3 with 5:02 left.\nCourtney Vandersloot's jumper with 3:32 left was the Sky's first field goal in nearly 6 minutes, cutting Phoenix's lead to 77-74.\nTaurasi completed a three-point play a minute later for a four-point lead before Delle Donne cut it to two again. Quigley's jumper tied it with 33.1 seconds left before Taurasi took control.\nPhoenix's sweep in the finals was the fourth in the last five years, and fifth since the championship round went to a best-of-five format in 2005.\nChicago was the first team with a losing record during the regular season to reach the finals.\nThe Mercury led by as much as five in the third quarter. Taurasi was called for a technical foul with Phoenix ahead 51-48, but Delle Donne missed the free throw. Fowles' layup tied it at 59, Delle Donne's two free throws gave the Sky the lead, and Quigley's jumper put the Sky up four with 29.1 seconds left.\nDupree then scored to pull Phoenix within two going into the fourth.\nPhoenix led 45-43 at halftime.

        "instruction": "While empathy has always been an important trait among healthcare professionals, studies show it\u2019s due to become a competitive differentiator as AI allows more healthcare roles to be turned over to efficient but impartial machines.\nAs common illnesses are now diagnosed online, vital signs are monitored by digital devices and medications are administered by computer, human practitioners are increasingly being reserved for the face-to-face tasks that can\u2019t be handled digitally. As such, those skilled in such \u201chigh-touch\u201d interactions are standing out from the crowd.\nBut that\u2019s not the only reason for health organizations to teach and encourage empathy, and to hire people who display the trait. Research shows the practice can lead to tangible medical and financial results.\nThe paper also suggests more empathetic care could impact health costs by reducing the need for the prescription painkillers that make up 10 percent of annual costs incurred by the NHS.\nFurther studies point to the power of empathy in reducing patients\u2019 post-operative pain, boosting their immune systems, lowering hospitalization rates for diabetics and increasing the odds of survival among cancer patients and high-risk cardiac patients, report Mara Fiorese and Stefano Alice in a recent World Economic Forum article.\nThe physicians say the grueling nature of many healthcare careers can cause workers to seem uncaring. But they argue that situation needs to change, starting at the educational level. While empathy is apparently innate in some people, research shows it can also be a learned skill.\nNote that empathy is different from pity. It means recognizing, acknowledging and respecting the feelings of others, not (necessarily) feeling sorry for them.\nBe aware of your non-verbal communication. For better or worse, your body language, pauses, sighs and voice quality (tone, pitch and loudness) reveal much of what you\u2019re really thinking.\nUnderstand empathy may require patience. \u201cDuring the process, physicians must challenge themselves to stay with a difficult discussion, which opens the door for the patient to admit uncertainty and grieve the loss of normalcy in life,\u201d notes a press release on the URMC study.\nPracticing empathy won\u2019t always be easy for healthcare workers who work long hours under grueling conditions. But in his book \u201cTime to Care,\u201d anesthesiologist Dr. Robin Youngson discusses how it could help many rediscover job satisfaction. Based on the passage above, What are the benefits of empathetic care for patients and how can empathy help healthcare workers rediscover job satisfaction?",

There shall be no transfer of the Judge conducting the trial until the entire trial concludes. The case shall not be adjourned on any ground except when the sessions court finds it impossible to carry on the trial for that particular date,\u201d the apex court had then said.\nThere were two sets of cases relating to the demolition of the disputed structure on December 6, 1992. The first involved unnamed \u2018karsevaks\u2019, the trial of which is taking place in a Lucknow court, while the second set of cases relate to the leaders in a Rae Bareli court.\nThe Apex Court had ordered clubbing of th separate trials in the trial courts of Raebareli and Lucknow should be clubbed, to be conducted in Lucknow.\nThe conspiracy charge against 13 accused including Advani, Joshi and Bharti was dropped in the case, the trial of which was being held at a special court in Rae Bareli.\nThe second set of case was against unknown \u2018karsevaks\u2019 who were in and around the disputed structure and had pulled it down. The trial against them was being held in a Lucknow court.\nThe appeals were filed by one Haji Mahboob Ahmad (since dead) and the CBI against dropping of conspiracy charges against 21 accused including the top BJP leaders, eight of whom have died.\nA supplementary charge sheet was filed against eight persons, but not the 13 who were discharged for plotting the demolition.\nThe appeals have sought setting aside of the Allahabad High Court\u2019s order of May 20, 2010, dropping section 120B (criminal conspiracy) under the IPC while upholding a special court\u2019s decision.\nThe CBI had charge-sheeted Advani and 20 others under sections 153A (promoting enmity between classes), 153B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) and 505 (false statements, rumours etc circulated with the intent to cause mutiny or disturb public peace) of the IPC.\nIt had subsequently invoked charges under section 120B (criminal conspiracy), which was quashed by the special court whose decision was upheld by the high court. Based on the passage above, How has the trial been proceeding in the Lucknow court for the unnamed 'karsevaks' accused in the case, and what is the current status of their trial?",

Fresh berries (black berries, blue berries, raspberries) are not always in season, and smoothies are often very fatty. In this post, I\u2019m going to be showing you how to make a \u2018Healthy Mixed Berries Smoothie\u2019. It\u2019s guilt-free, and absolutely delicious! It\u2019s really easy! Just combine all of the ingredients in a blender and puree until smooth. The good thing about frozen mixed berries is that you know that they won\u2019t be as sour and unripe and sour as berries that are overpriced if not in season.

Then I decided to try my OWN recipe. This recipe that I made. If you do decided to post this recipe on your blog, please give credits, or re-blog this. 2. In a medium bowl, mix all your dry ingredients. Soften your butter, and do what I do- I just cut out the piece I need, put it in a microwave safe bowl and then leave it in there for 30 seconds, as you do not want it completely melted. 3. After the try ingredients, mix the wet ingredients together. 4. Next, mix all the ingredients together. Then, after mixing, roll the dough with a rolling pin. Finally, use the cookie cutters to cut cute shapes, and put them in the oven. You don\u2019t need to grease the pan you will use. And remember to place cookies 1 inch apart on your cookie sheet. NOTE: If you feel like the cookies will be too sticky, you can grease it. I prefer not to. 5. And in 6-8 minutes, your delicious cookies will be done! Cool completely. Tip for frosting: Make it fairly thin, as if your \u2018painting\u2019 the icing on the cookies with a pastry brush. Thin enough to spread easily but not so thin that it just makes your cookies wet and runs off. That\u2019s about it!

( Even though it\u2019s not, summer, it\u2019s pretty hot right now) I call this the \u2018Ice Shaker\u2019. So it\u2019s basically a Coke Float, and it\u2019s really easy to make! Let\u2019s get started! We all know how much Pepsi is against Coca Cola and how much Coca Cola is against Pepsi. And if you didn\u2019t know, Mike and Ike is now either \u2018Ike\u2019 or \u2018Mike\u2019!!! OMG, that\u2019s JUST WEIRD!! (I\u2019m Team Ike by the way!) If you want a post about that, you can comment down in comment section below\u2026. Step 2: Next pour Coke into the glass. It doesn\u2019t matter which soda you use. My recommended beverages are Coke, Sprite and Root Beer. Step 4: DONE!!! Enjoy your fizzy, tasty drink! If you wish, you can add whipped cream on the top! Fun Fact: BTW, I tried my first Coke Float at McDonald\u2019s. Yum. It\u2019s super easy, super quick! Try it out, and tell me how it went down in the comment section below! Try Root beer Float as well, exactly the same process, just different beverage! Categories: Uncategorized | Tags: Coke Float, Cooking, Fun, Heat Waves, Recipes, Root Beer, Summertime | Permalink.

They manage to do everything and still have time to hang with the kids. How does she do it? No one really knows, but it starts with a cup of coffee. In honor of all the superhero moms running on coffee and love alone, I bring you coffee-filled recipes that are sure to please. A few of these recipes call of instant espresso powder, which is a type of quick-dissolving coffee crystals. Check your grocery store; they\u2019re often in the coffee section in little glass jars. Instant espresso is richer and darker than instant coffee, but you can use the coffee in a pinch -- just add 1 1/2 times the amount of espresso called for. This Mother\u2019s Day treat your mom to something special, but first make sure she\u2019s caffeinated. Turn your kitchen into a French bistro with Laura Calder\u2019s Coffee Eclairs (filled with vanilla pastry cream and topped with a coffee glaze.) Get crazy with your eclairs and fill them with Coffee Pastry Cream instead. The dieting mom\u2019s delight: Coffee Angel Food Cake (pictured above) with sweet coffee glaze. It\u2019s a dessert and a cocktail at the same time, Giada\u2019s Mexican Coffee is a drink your multitasking mom would be proud of. Take the ultimate combo of Coffee and Doughnuts to the next level. This doughnut dough proofs twice for ultra light texture, just be sure to start this project a few hours before you want to eat. So your mom\u2019s more into savory? Singaporean Coffee Ribs are the way to go. Marinated and then fried, these ribs are tossed in a coffee-oyster sauce glaze and finished with some ground cinnamon. Nom. It\u2019s officially iced coffee season. And if you\u2019re not making cold-brew coffee, you\u2019re doing it wrong. Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide on making your very own cup of cold brew. Granita is an easy Italian iced treat that requires no ice cream maker and very few ingredients. Try out Alton Brown\u2019s super simple Coffee Granita. Irish Cream and Coffee Cookies are topped with an Irish cream Italian meringue buttercream frosting. Butter-based cookies need to go into the oven chilled to retain their shape. Chill the cookie dough in the fridge for at least an hour to avoid pancake cookies. Chicory root is a caffeine-free coffee substitute with a rich roasted flavor. Give chicory the ol\u2019 college try with Bobby Flay\u2019s bourbon-filled Coffee Milk Punch or Spiked Iced Chicory Coffee. Ingrid Hoffman\u2019s Coffee and Cola Pork Loin gets two-part loving. The first is an overnight brine and the second is a coffee, sugar and spices dry rub. Have a bunch of moms you want to impress? Make a batch of Espresso Coffee Truffles, and you\u2019ll be the favorite child. Cut down on cooling time by setting the chocolate in the fridge to harden up. Sometimes staying in is more of a treat than going out (especially on holidays when restaurants tend to set prix fixe menus). Ellie Krieger\u2019s Cowboy Steak with Coffee and Chili Rub cooks up in less than 15 minutes. Don\u2019t forget to rest the steak (or any meat) for a few minutes after cooking to let the juices redistribute. Mom loves no-mess projects and Nigella\u2019s One-Step No-Churn Coffee Ice Cream will satisfy her sweet tooth. Nigella suggests serving a big scoop of the coffee ice cream on small, sweet brioche buns as an Italian ice cream sandwich. Pull out all the stops for mom and surprise her with Emeril\u2019s Chocolate Coffee Flan. If you\u2019re running short on time, top any dessert or even her morning coffee with Coffee Whipped Cream. You forgot to make dinner reservations and now you\u2019re panicking. Bring the tapas restaurant home with Chuck Hughes\u2019 slow-roasted Pork Belly and Scallop Starter with Coffee Glaze, which utilizes the braising liquid as the base for the coffee glaze. Keep it simple by brewing mom the best cup of coffee. Here\u2019s a \u201chow to\u201d just for you. Andrea\u2019s Hand Cranked Coffee Cavatelli will certainly impress. Handmade coffee pasta is served with porcini, squash, oranges and arugula. The recipe calls for calabaza, a winter squash, but you can substitute with butternut, acorn or whatever squash is available. Bobby Flay\u2019s Chocolate Caramel Hazelnut Ice Coffee comes together in a snap and has everything you look for on a hot day filled with family. Make extra -- you\u2019ll probably want to save a few glasses of this for yourself. Coming in at under 70 calories per serving, Hungry Girl\u2019s Super-Duper Cocoa-Rific Coffee Malt is a win and mom will thank you for the low-cal pick-me-up. Heat up the grill for a mess-free kitchen, and get started on the Keawe Grilled Baby Back Ribs with Kona Coffee BBQ Grilling and Dipping Sauce. For the mom that can\u2019t decide what she\u2019s in the mood for, Momofuku Compost Cookies are everything you crave (think graham crackers, potato chips, pretzels, butterscotch and chocolate chips) in one delicious cookie. A low calorie brownie is a treat for everyone. Lighter Brownies are only 95 calories per square, but a little instant coffee brings out the rich cocoa flavor for a satisfying dessert. Raid your pantry (specifically cookie sandwiches, coffee, bananas and condensed milk) to make layered Banoffee Pie. Show mom you care with Beatty\u2019s Chocolate Cake, because that\u2019s what love looks like.",

I\u2019ve just driven one \u2014 a Rolls-Royce Ghost EWB \u2014 and while it doesn\u2019t leave me pale with fright, it does bring on a certain shade of green. Envy, I think.\nMy wife, Pat, and I were celebrating our 50th anniversary, a milestone statistics say only five per cent of married couples reach. That means a couple of five percenters got to live like one percenters, if only for a couple of days.\nWhen Patrick Kirkwood of Ferrari Maserati Roll Royce of Alberta handed me the key to the most luxurious automobile I\u2019ve driven in 20 plus years of reviewing cars, it had a mere eight kilometres on the odometer.\nFirst impressions? This car carries its bulk \u2014 2,970 kilograms \u2014 with dignity and style. Proportions are spot on and the subtle two-tone paintwork is flawless.\nI love the \u201csuicide\u201d rear doors which allow a wide area for a rather majestic entry or exit should one desire to make that impression. Front passengers enjoy 1,060 mm (41.7 in.) of legroom while rear riders can stretch out across 1,245 mm (49 in.) of space. And there\u2019s lots of room to carry luggage for all occasions in the 490L trunk (oops, I mean boot).\nThe interior is pure luxury: leather, wood, even deep lamb\u2019s wool floor mats that encouraged Pat to kick off her shoes and wriggle her toes in that deep, soft, pile as she leaned back in her seat to enjoy the ride.\nHer chauffeur (me) kept his shoes on.\nIt was cloudy when we left, but the panoramic sunroof kept the interior bright. Passengers get a fold-down centre console to allow control of telephone, the bespoke audio\u2019s functions, a map display and seat adjustments. Add in creature features like rear theatre and picnic tables and it seemed a shame we didn\u2019t have a chauffeur\u2026except I like to drive and this car is a dream to pilot down the highway.\nWhile there\u2019s an abundance of electronics on board the Ghost, it\u2019s the simplicity of the features that\u2019s striking. Controls are easy to use, thoughtfully laid out and they don\u2019t cause distraction for the driver. It took very little time to become completely at home with the location and operation of controls and switches. No annoyingly complicated dance through non-intuitive menus here. Within 15 minutes I was comfortable with all the systems. It seems even sensible controls are a luxury these days.\nA host of driver assistance programs were on tap including active cruise control with stop and go, lane departure warning, head-up display, side view camera, rear-view camera with top view and all the usual driving nannies. The optional night vision camera provided a ghostly image of animals and humans within its considerable coverage range.\nOur anniversary route took us from Calgary to the Post Hotel in Lake Louise, a luxury establishment famous for its service, attention to detail, great wine cellar and outstanding kitchen. Hey, you gotta splurge on your 50th anniversary!\nIn a car like this, you never take the direct route. Getting there is way more than half the fun, besides the Trans Canada is a bit boring and I wanted to experience the Ghost more fully.\nFor such a big vehicle, it\u2019s surprisingly nimble and all that subdued elegance hides a playful side. There\u2019s more than enough muscle to move it along with a satisfying surge of acceleration. Power from the 563 horsepower of its 6.5L V-12 engine gets to the rear wheels through a near-seamless eight-speed automatic transmission. Pushed by 605 pound-feet of torque, the combination propels the Ghost to 100 km/h in five seconds and passing velocities on the highway are attained in spook-tacular fashion.\nGhost is by no means a fuel-sipper even when driven sedately, but then if you own or lease one of these beauties, the 15.3 L/100 km I averaged poses no financial burden when re-filling the 82.5L tank with premium gasoline.\nA host of optional equipment boosted the $337,275 entry price to a total of $473,443.95 (including fees, $5,800 for freight and $3,800 for PDI). Of course GST is extra bringing the tab to just under a half-million bucks.\nThere\u2019s not a ghost of a chance I will afford one of these beauties with the Spirit of Ecstasy on the hood, but it was nice to act the part for a few days.\nHarry Pegg is a member of the Automobile Journalists Association of Canada.\nHarry and Pat in the summer of 1966. They are still motoring together 50 years later.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: What is the author's opinion on the performance and handling of the Rolls-Royce Ghost EWB?",

The company argues that its marketing practices are responsible, and that its food is \"high quality.\"\nThe push to retire Ronald is being led by a group called Corporate Accountability International, which plans to introduce a resolution calling for the clown's ouster at the company's annual shareholder meeting Thursday.\n\"Through this initiative, the public health community is rallying behind a simple message to McDonald's: stop making the next generation sick -- retire Ronald and the rest of your junk food marketing to kids,\" said Steven Rothschild, a professor at Rush Medical College and a backer of the resolution.\nMcDonald's is already being sued by a group of consumers and health care professionals over the toys that come in the Happy Meals marketed to kids. The group filed a class action suit late last year in California that claims the company's marketing practices violate state's consumer protection laws.\nIn addition, a group of Philadelphia nuns filed a proxy resolution in March asking McDonald's to investigate its \"policy response\" to concerns about the link between fast food and childhood obesity.\nMcDonalds stands by Ronald and says that it is committed to children's health and nutrition.\n\"We are committed to responsible advertising and take our communications to children very seriously,\" McDonald's said in a statement.\nThe company has argued that it has introduced healthy alternatives such as Apple Dippers and low-fat milk in Happy Meals. But critics say the company still serves French fries in the vast majority of its kid-friendly combo meals.\nMcDonald's (MCD, Fortune 500) also stressed that Ronald is the symbol of its flag-ship charity, Ronald McDonald house, which is dedicated to the health and well being of children.\n\"Ronald is an ambassador for good and delivers important messages to kids on safety, literacy and balanced, active lifestyles,\" the statement said.\nRonald McDonald, one of the world's most recognizable clowns, has been the company's mascot since 1971. He was joined shortly there after by a cast of imaginary characters including the Hamburglar, Grimace, Mayor McCheese and Captain Crook.",

The project was a collaboration among Sandia, the University of New South Wales, the University of Leeds, the University of the Pacific and the University of Minnesota.\nIn addition to being the smallest organic acid and an important chemical for communication among ants, formic acid is the most abundant organic acid in the global atmosphere and a major source of rainwater acidity. However, global atmospheric models significantly underpredict the amount of formic acid present in the troposphere compared to direct measurements. Because formic acid lies at the end point of hydrocarbon oxidation, this underestimate calls into question current scientific understanding of hydrocarbon degradation in the atmosphere. It is critical to understand the origin of this underprediction, because accurate predictions of air quality and of aerosol impacts on climate rely on a sound representation of atmospheric hydrocarbon chemistry. The new research highlights how nonequilibrium processes bring models closer to reality, but with an unexpected twist.\nThe answer to this puzzle came through Osborn\u2019s explorations of a foundational scientific Grand Challenge from the DOE\u2019s Office of Basic Energy Sciences, which funded the work: to harness systems far from equilibrium. Forcing a chemical system far from equilibrium could allow chemists to explore unusual molecular configurations that may have valuable properties for energy capture and energy storage.\nOsborn\u2019s team thought that photons \u2014 in particular ultraviolet light \u2014 would be an ideal tool to drive a chemical system far from equilibrium, but collisions between molecules inevitably lead to a restoration of equilibrium. For this reason, it wasn\u2019t clear whether the approach would work at atmospheric pressure, where collision between molecules occur about 7 billion times each second.\n\u201cThis dramatic increase in vinyl alcohol concentration now enables new oxidation chemistry that isn\u2019t possible from acetaldehyde,\u201d Osborn said.\nHis team postulated that vinyl alcohol could be oxidized to yield formic acid, a pathway supported by recent theoretical calculations that predicted a rate constant for this process. With the experimental and theoretical details in hand, Osborn\u2019s collaborators could add this chemistry to local and global models of Earth\u2019s atmosphere to see how it might alter formic acid concentrations.\nSince 1999, Osborn has explored the mechanisms of gas-phase chemical reactions at Sandia\u2019s Combustion Research Facility. The high temperatures encountered in practical combustion provide a fertile ground to test fundamental questions of chemical reactivity. Improving the fundamental understanding of chemical change directly addresses Department of Energy goals that span disciplines, such as the ability to transform energy in a controlled way between electrical, chemical and kinetic reservoirs.\n\u201cThis research shows how photons can push systems far from equilibrium, creating new chemical pathways that could allow increased control over energy transformations, even in environments with many randomizing collisions that seek to re-establish equilibrium,\u201d Osborn said.

This can help players develop their emotional intelligence and understanding of human relationships in a way that no other form of art can offer.\n\nVideo games have had a massive influence in shaping popular culture and have made a profound impact on society. It has been argued that video games have become even more influential than classic art forms like painting, sculpture and theatre in terms of their reach, engagement and impact.

According to Dr Michael Klaper, cow\u2019s milk is baby calf growth fluid. Thus, it is loaded with fats, lactose (milk sugar), proteins (casein and whey proteins: beta-lactoglobulin and alpha-lactalbumin), and over 60 hormones, including estrogen, that promote the rapid growth of a calf. Unlike humans, cattle need to gain weight rapidly. In fact, cow's milk doubles the weight of a baby calf in 50-60 days. Estrogen is one of the major growth-promoting hormones found in milk and other dairy products.\nDairy products such as milk, cheese, butter, and yogurt are considered to be an essential component of human diets especially in Western cultures and recently in Asia. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, more than 6 billion people worldwide consume milk and related dairy products.\nCow\u2019s milk is extracted from the mammary gland of a lactating cow. Female cattle undergo hormonal cycles similar to that of adult human females; they also naturally produce estrogen during their reproductive cycle. Plasma levels of estrogen increase in cows during pregnancy, rising from 15 pg/ml in non-pregnant cows to 151 pg/ml in the first half of pregnancy and 1000 pg/ml in the last days of pregnancy. Keeping these cows almost constantly pregnant ensures that milk products contain an extremely high level of estrogens.\nMost of the estrogens circulating in a cow's blood eventually find their way to the cow\u2019s breast milk. Unfortunately, millions of baby calves worldwide will be deprived of the milk from their mother\u2019s mammary glands, so that human children as well as adults can consume this nutrient-dense growth fluid containing high amounts of estrogens meant for the speedy growth of those baby calves. The findings of many studies have shown that dairy foods, such as milk, yogurt, cheese, and ice cream are responsible for 60-70 per cent of estrogen found in humans that are coming from food sources.\nAre Dairy Products Healthy Foods?",

This is why, at the UN Climate Conference in Paris this month, world leaders sought to reach a new international agreement on climate change, essentially to keep global warming below 2\u00b0C (or 3.6\u00b0F). Rising temperatures pose threats on food and water security, infrastructure, ecosystems and health and, as a previous blog on this site shows, increases the risk of conflict. With an upsurge in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events and the potential for rapid sea level rise, both mitigating human-related exacerbation of climate change, and adapting to its devastating effects are key priorities. This is where education comes in.\nBoth mitigation and adaptation require technological, institutional and behavioral responses. Correspondingly, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change highlighted the value of a mix of strategies to protect the planet, which combine policies with incentive-based approaches encompassing all actors from the individual citizen, to national governments and international communities. Because, while national and sub-national climate action plans are fundamental, changing individual behaviour also lies at the heart of responses to climate change.\nAt the individual level, barriers to the adoption of mitigation and adaptation measures include a lack of awareness and understanding of climate change risk, doubt about efficacy of one\u2019s action, lack of knowledge on how to change behavior and lack of financial resources to implement changes. Accordingly, there are many sound reasons to assume that different education strategies can help overcome these barriers both in direct and indirect manners.\nResponding to the challenges of climate change is going to require action on multiple fronts. Ignoring the impacts of education on climate change is no longer an option. Promoting universal secondary education should be given a high priority on the agenda as we look forward past last week\u2019s Paris meeting.",

Although prosecutors requested $25,000 bail, the judge released her under supervision that day, according to prosecutors. She is next due back in court Oct. 10.\n\u25ba A 36-year-old man from Philadelphia used a stolen credit card to buy a $6,000 Chanel bag at Bloomingdale's at 1000 Third Ave., police said. The suspect had grabbed the card from a woman's wallet as she dined at Serafina on East 61st Street on Aug. 10 and used it at Bloomingdale's later that day around 2:24 p.m., police said. Because it was a large purchase, store security did an audit and found that the victim had contacted American Express to report the card stolen. Police found that the suspect also had two other stolen credit cards on him.\n\u25ba A woman dining at Calexico at 1491 Second Ave. left her wallet inside her baby carriage and later found that someone had stolen it while she wasn't looking at around 1:30 p.m. on July 29, police said. The $500 Louis Vuitton wallet contained $725 cash, a $50 MetroCard and various store credit cards, police said. Calexico did not return a request for comment Monday.\n\u25ba A Fresh Direct worker was arrested for three burglaries police say he committed while on his route in October of last year, as well as June and July of this year. Detectives found that the 24-year-old from Brooklyn stole a $400 David Yurman bracelet from an apartment on East 69th Street, $23,155 in jewelry from a night stand in an apartment on East 71st Street, and $500 cufflinks from another apartment on East 76th Street, police said. In the last two burglaries, the worker left their Fresh Direct packages in front of their doors. Fresh Direct could not be reached for comment Monday.\n\u25ba Thieves stole nearly $12,000 in Ralph Lauren merchandise from the fashion brand's Madison Avenue store in separate incidents on Aug. 10, police said. A man took 20 \"Purple Label\" items valued at $9,009 and fled the store around 3:48 p.m., while another two suspects walked out with a $2,950 handbag about two hours later, police said. The NYPD is still investigating the thefts. Ralph Lauren did not return a request for comment Monday.\n\u25ba A worker's tools valued at $2,332 were stolen out of his van parked at the southwest corner of Park Avenue and East 60th Street on Aug. 10 sometime between 2:16 and 5 p.m., police said. The man returned to his van and saw that the backdoor was open and the tools were missing. Police are investigating.",

In this interview we get to hear all about the scandinavian culinary style of the New Nordic Cuisine.\nWhat moved you to become a chef?\nIn 2009 after a party, my friends and I met up in the apartment of an acquaintance. Everyone was really hungry and there wasn\u2019t much in the fridge except some tired lame stuff. Among us was a chef who whipped up an amazing snack with tartar sauce. I was really blown away and at that moment I was struck with the desire to learn that skill as well, so I ended up in a cafe in St. Petersburg.\nYou\u2019ve worked in restaurants in Finland and Estonia. What was your most important moment from these times?\nInternships are always a new experience and a new discovery for me, and it was also the case in Estonia, Spain and Finland. The gastronomy there\u2026 is another world, such that everything is organized down to the finest detail, every employee, waiter and chef knows their exact role, duties and responsibilities. It\u2019s like a living organism that works like a swiss clock. That is exactly what I strive for in my restaurant. That\u2019s where I came up with the ideas for the New Nordic Cuisine where the complex and conceptual ideas were impressed on me. I was extremely pleased to be able to meet so many talented chefs as well.\nHow would you describe New Nordic Cuisine and how does it differ from traditional scandinavian cuisine?\nNew Nordic Cuisine is a combination of the best nordic culinary traditions, new trends, and also technology from other countries. It also focuses on seasonal and local products.\nWhich dish is loved the most by guests in the restaurant \u201cNordic\u201d?\nThe favorite at this moment is our crustacean soup featuring Kamchatka crab, salmon from the Faroe Islands and spaghetti vongole.\nCould you share your favorite dish with us?\nAll my dishes are loved by me deeply, born through fire. I love them all. Every dish has gone through my head, heart and hands.\nWhich technologies do you utilize in restaurant \u201cNordic\u201d?\nI always stay abreast of new technologies and use appropriate technology in my work. At the moment I am very involved with fermentation which is practiced by scandinavian chefs. I started off with a simple type, the Lacto-fermentation. Fermentation emphasizes and enhances the flavor of products and opens the way for new sensations. We also practice dehydration, making chips from vegetables, fruits, berries, cereals and broth. This gives our dishes a pleasant crunch and surprises the guests with a taste experience.\nWhich local products do you work with and which products are imported?\nWe try to use only local products in line with our concept. Around 90 percent of our product is sourced locally, karelian berries, mushrooms, roots and microgreens. A lot of products grow right here in the Leningrad region. Gourmet foods such as game or Muksun (a white fish) come direct from the Yamal and the Yenisei region, scallops, oysters and the Kamchatka crab from the Far East. An example of a product that is imported would be the salmon from the Faroe Islands, a fish unmatched in quality and fits very well with our concept.\nWhere do you find inspiration for new dishes? How do you go about consant improvement?\nI read many books and watch many videos, research complex chemical processes, and the compatibility of different products in order to bring forth new tastes and experiences. The art of cooking is a whole science which instills in me an interest and love, which ultimately leads to the inspiration and creations of new dishes.\nIn your opinion, what impression do your guests take away from visiting your restaurant?\nI think they always leave in a good mood.\nWhat are the plans for the future and do you have a \u201ccareer dream\u201d?\nI dream that restaurant \u201cNordic\u201d will be the central gastronomic attraction in St. Petersburg and the President will stop by.\nWhat is your process for creating new dishes, and how do you strive for constant improvement in your cooking?",

Flow is often associated with peak performance, when people are fully engaged in activities like art, sports, gaming, and meditation.

In 1916, Sperry, with the help of his father Elmer, demonstrated the first automatic pilot.Starting 1914 to 1918, many improvements in the structure and control of the airplane were witnessed.\nThe complete machine should include a battery connected to a DC motor by electricity wires-probably made of copper, the motor connected to the gear system by use of the sprocket and the gear system connected to the lifting system by the output sprocket.The lifting of the weights is indirectly proportional to the number of gears used, and sizes of their sprockets. Use of large gears will enhance little motion and lifting of little weight while the use of small gears brings about a greater force.\nTesting and evaluation include safety of use, possibilities of replacements in case of breakdown, usability and much more. The process offers a chance to assure the quality of garage doors and that they built right. Therefore, testing is projected to occur continuously during the development process to ensure that everything is appropriately functional (Fox, 2013).

        "instruction": "Viewing the Future in the Past is a collection of essays that presents a wide range of authors, loci, and subjects that together demonstrate the value and necessity of looking at environmental problems as a long-term process that involves humans as a causal factor. Editors H. Thomas Foster II, Lisa M. Paciulli, and David J. Goldstein argue that it is increasingly apparent to environmental and earth sciences experts that humans have had a profound effect on the physical, climatological, and biological earth. Consequently they suggest that understanding any aspect of the earth within the last ten thousand years means understanding the density and activities of Homo sapiens.\nThe essays reveal the ways in which archaeologists and anthropologists have devised methodological and theoretical tools and applied them to pre-Columbian societies in the New World and ancient sites in the Middle East. Some of the authors demonstrate how these tools can be useful in examining modern societies. The contributors provide evidence that past and present ecosystems, economies, and landscapes must be understood through the study of human activity over millennia and across the globe.\nH. Thomas Foster II is an associate professor of anthropology at the University of Tulsa. He received his Ph.D. from Pennsylvania State University and is the author of Archaeology of the Lower Muskogee Creek Indians, 1715\u20131836 and The Collected Works of Benjamin Hawkins, 1796\u20131810.\nLisa Paciulli has a Ph.D. in anthropological sciences from Stony Brook University and teaches biology at North Carolina State University. She has published articles in American Journal of Primatology, Folia Primatologica, Primate Conservation, and Journal of Medical and Biological Sciences.\nDavid J. Goldstein is the chief of interpretation and education for three National Park Service units on St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. He received his Ph.D. in anthropology from Southern Illinois University Carbondale and is a research associate with the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago and a visiting lecturer at the Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia in Lima, Peru.

The item is made of cotton and measures 35 x 36 inches. Photo by E.G. Schempf.\nMELBOURNE, FLA. \u2014 An exhibition of 28 flower cloths and embroidered articles of \u201cstory cloths\u201d from the Hmong culture opens Sept. 23 at Florida Institute of Technology\u2019s Ruth Funk Center for Textile Arts.\nThe clothing and flower cloths, known as paj ntaub, illustrate the profound relevance of textiles as infrastructure in the China- and Southeast Asia-based Hmong culture and highlight an art form that shifted as it adapted to fit new realities.\nIn addition to the textile pieces, Cloth as Community: Hmong Textiles in America will feature activity stations throughout the exhibition, as well as feature photographs of contemporary Hmong women and children in traditional dress by local artist Peter Kastan.\n\u201cNot only will we be showcasing the unique talent of Hmong artists, but our exhibition will also allow visitors to engage with personal stories of immigration, travel and culture,\u201d said Keidra Navaroli, the center\u2019s assistant director and curator.\nThe story of Hmong textile production reflects the shift in the creation of textiles with traditional abstract patterns created for family and ceremonial use to its evolution as a source of commerce and telling of a new life abroad. The works also reveal the radical upheaval Hmong refugees experienced.\nHmong women traditionally produced complex clothing that established clan identity through abstract geometric designs, created by embroidery, appliqu\u00e9, reverse appliqu\u00e9, and indigo batik. These patterns continue to influence the aesthetic choices of contemporary makers, even as those choices were mediated by refugee experience and economic concerns.\nDespite its deep roots in Hmong culture, this complex art was not widely known outside Asia until after the Vietnam War, when Hmong refugees arrived in the United States. Later, as the memory of the Vietnam War receded and American buyers required more upbeat subjects, many of the story cloth subjects morphed into representations of a new life in America or nostalgia for the pastoral life left behind.\nThe works in this exhibition demonstrate a period in time when old paj ntaub influenced new designs. The works show how the profound relevance of textiles as infrastructure in the Hmong social fabric has never been part of a fixed cultural tableau, even as the narrative is adapted to fit new realities.\nOrganized and toured by ExhibitsUSA, a national part of Mid-America Arts Alliance, the exhibition was first curated in 1999 by Carl Magnuson, a cultural anthropologist working with a Hmong refugee community. Curatorial updates have been done by Geraldine Craig, who has published more than a hundred essays on contemporary art and Hmong textiles and now serves as department head of art at Kansas State University.\nCloth as Community: Hmong Textiles in America closes Dec. 16.\nRegular hours for the center will be 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Friday and noon to 4 p.m. Saturday. The center is located next to Evans Library on the Florida Tech campus, 150 W. University Blvd. in Melbourne. Admission is free. More information at http://textiles.fit.edu/.",

Over time, this leads to the development of new species which are better suited to the environment. Artificial selection, on the other hand, involves humans directly selecting which organisms are able to reproduce. Unlike natural selection, this is a conscious decision where humans selectively choose which organisms gain reproductive advantages. This is done in order to produce organisms with a desired trait or characteristic, such as larger fruits or better yields. Both natural and artificial selection are important processes that have allowed us to shape the world and its organisms as we know it.",

It dates back to the time when the Forest of Dean, the land between the River Severn and the River Wye, was designated royal hunting forest (the wild bore are coming back and often visit us in the night).\nLooking from the vantage point of The Wilderness down to the River Severn, you can clearly see the broad curves of the river heading out to the Bristol Channel. Over the course of a day you\u2019ll see the tide ebb and flow. In earlier times, from this point, you\u2019d have seen Roman vessels plying their trade up and down the river. Later on, and more alarmingly, you\u2019d have seen Viking raiders coming up river.\nThe recent history of The Wilderness, though diverse, has a common thread running through it that we want to sustain; it\u2019s somewhere special, it\u2019s nurturing and homely and it\u2019s a place where you\u2019ll grow and learn.\nThe house here was built in the early nineteenth century as a family home. In the early twentieth century the site became a children\u2019s hospital, specialising in infectious diseases. In the 1960\u2019s Gloucestershire County Council acquired The Wilderness, turning it into an outdoors education and nature studies centre serving the county\u2019s schools (a number of which are still clients). Dan and Sophie Sturdy bought The Wilderness in 2015 as a key location in their vision for human potential and growth. Who currently owns The Wilderness and what is their vision for it?",

His wish: \"if we ever play against a top team in the future - and we win - they need to be embarrassed\".. After a while of brainstorming, the result was Unicorns of Love. It was also chosen since playing League of Legends should be about having fun and being different.\nSpring 2014: The team met for the first time in real life at Insomnia 51. After a very chaotic preperation they won the entire tournament.\nWinter 2014: After a failed first attempt, the team qualified for the promotion tournament... and won against Millenium with some very surprising (weird) picks in a bo5. After qualifying for the LCS, they got voted to IEM San Jose 2014. A lot of people thought they are too weak, but after a shaky first round they came to face TSM, the number 1 team of NA LCS. With Twisted Fate jungle and a base race they won against TSM and we gained a lot of fans over night.\nSpring 2015: In their first ever LCS split, the team went through to the playoffs and ended up in the finals against Fnatic. After a close series they lost and finished second. What a great first split that was though.\n2015-2017: Unicorns of Love was the only team that always made it to playoffs, Also we kept being unique and fun and had a lot of great events, partners, sponsors and fan interactions. Also we are the first team to have an official fanclub: the LoveHurtsCrew e.V.\n2018: Things went downhill after some issues with players and health. For the first time ever the team didn't reach the playoffs. Still we put a lot of effort in building up the community and bringing in new things. With partners like Wacken or Billyboy and events like the Deadpool 2 premiere we for sure had a lot of fun and success in 2018 overall.\n2019: LCS becomes LEC and is now a franchise league. Investing millions to be part of this league is not something we believe in. We always worked without any investors, to keep our vision, players and staff save. We want to have the final say in our own company and keep creating the esports scene the way we feel it's best. Therefor we stepped down from LCS/LEC and focus on the german League of Legends scene. Also we now have a CS:GO team to expand our brand in the esports scene. Possibly we will add other titles to the UOL family, what we know for sure is that there are a lot of great things to come in 2019 and the future.",

        "instruction": "If you thought you were the only one that came to Denmark for a woman, got stranded here and eventually came to think of the country as being full of stone cold and icy-hearted witches, then think again. Expats have been following Danish women here since the times of King James IV of Scotland back in the late 1500s. In 1589, after marrying Princess Anne of Denmark (King Christian IV\u2019s sister) by proxy, King James IV waited for her to sail across the North Sea to join him in Scotland. However as her ship set off, it ran into severe storms and bad weather and Anne was forced to take refuge in Norway, where due to the coming winter, she abandoned her journey and took refuge. A lovestruck James, despite having seen nothing more than a portrait of his bride, was determined to see his bethrothed and sailed to Norway to fetch her. Forced to spend the winter there, the pair got officially married and then travelled down to Copenhagen. After arriving in Denmark, King James IV was introduced to the culture of witch-hunting. He would take the custom with him back to his kingdom in Scotland, which led to the country\u2019s first major prosecution of witches \u2013 the North Berwick Witch Trials of 1590. Denmark\u2019s own culture of witch-hunting goes back to at the least the late 1530s and increased considerably following the reformation of 1536 when Denmark broke off from the Catholic Church and became a Lutheran country. After the reformation, an overly zealous and influential Lutheran bishop by the name of Peder Palladius started preaching that anyone showing Catholic tendencies was most likely a witch, and he urged these witches to be hunted and burned. One of the most common accusations brought against witches was that they brought sickness to able-bodied persons in their prime. In the countryside they were charged with damaging cows and horses and causing bad milk and butter production. In 1559, Denmark became the first country in Scandinavia to have official witch trials, and in 1571 the first witch was found guilty and brought to the stake to be burned alive. The height of the witch-hunts was during the period 1617-1637 spurred on by a royal ordinance issued by Christian IV condemning witchcraft and declaring all those found guilty to be burned. It is estimated that around 2,000 witches were tried in Denmark with around half of them being executed. Despite the witch-hunt craze, the situation in Denmark never reached the extreme point that it did in other parts of Europe, thanks to a piece of legislation stating that anyone found guilty of crimes such as theft, treachery or sorcery would not be credited when giving witness against others. The law also stated that \u201cno person shall be interrogated before he is sentenced\u201d. This legislation effectively meant that those accused couldn\u2019t be tortured into providing the names of other so-called witches \u2013 something that commonly happened throughout other parts of Europe. By the 1700s, judges were starting to soften their view on witches. Ordinary folk, however, were harder to convince. In 1722 in the northwest Jutland town of Gr\u00f8nning, residents lynched and burned a supposed witch. The last recorded murder of a witch took place at Brigsted in Vejle in 1800. As for King James IV, who would go on to add England to his kingdom in 1603, his 1589 winter in witch-infested Denmark was enough to persuade him that he himself had fallen victim to their spells when he attempted to sail home and his ship faced harsh, stormy weather. When the Danish admiral of his ship blamed the bad weather on witches, and in particular on the wife of a high official who he had insulted, the king was determined to catch the evil doers and witchcraft trials weld held in both countries. It was this incident that led King James IV, who considered witchcraft part of theology and himself to be an expert in it, instigated the North Berwick Witch Trials. These trials saw over 100 witches accused and more than 70 burned. The king set up royal commissions to hunt down witches and in 1597 he even published a book on the subject, entitled \u2018Daemonologie\u2019. Traces of Denmark\u2019s witch burning past can still be seen each summer on June 23 in Sankt Hans Aften (St John\u2019s Eve) when Danes gather around bonfires to burn witches made of straw and cloth. Originally a pagan festival celebrating the summer solstice, the celebration has had various rituals attached to it over its history and the date had long been thought to be the best time to collect herbs for spells and different concoctions. The holiday also builds on the traditional belief that gathering around a fire together helps ward off evil spirits. Since the early 1900s, following the German tradition, Danes started to affix a figure resembling a witch to the top of the bonfire \u2013 a yearly reminder of the country\u2019s darker history. Can you summarize the history of witch hunting in Denmark and its connection to King James IV of Scotland?",

        "instruction": "How Onion Labs and Cond\u00e9 Nast's 23 Stories sell content marketing to advertisers.\nIn the \u201cSpecial Coverage\u201d section three-fourths of the way down TheOnion.com sits a set of articles sponsored by Explore Minnesota.\nClick the irreverent headline \u201cAll The Lame Recommendations We Got For What To Do In Seattle In 2016,\u201d and you\u2019ll be shown a slideshow of Washington State tourist spots with snarky captions complaining about Seattle as a travel destination.\nThe articles, created by Onion Labs, are funny enough on their own. Most are only tangentially related to the advertiser, whose branding and banner ads appear multiple times on each article. It\u2019s the type of content readers expect when they go to read The Onion. Minnesota is never mentioned, but the state\u2019s sponsorship of the article actually makes the joke funnier.\nThe Onion, which launched in 1988 as a weekly newspaper, reports an average of 30 million monthly unique visitors, most of whom come in search of satirical coverage of current events. It\u2019s a compelling but difficult audience for advertisers to reach on their own: critical of media and drawn to a voice that\u2019s in on the joke.\nBut ad fatigue goes beyond The Onion. Recent studies have found that the majority of digital natives have contempt for conventional advertising. A May 2016 Harris Poll conducted for Lithium found that 74 percent of 16 to 39 year olds dislike targeted social media ads, and 56 percent of this group reportedly cut back or cut out social media use in response to advertisements.\nA slide from Onion Lab\u2019s anti-Seattle article sponsored by Explore Minnesota.\nAd blocking is also on the rise. A November PageFair survey found that ad blockers have 18 percent penetration in the U.S., almost entirely on desktops, but increasingly on mobile devices worldwide. Additionally, 29 percent of U.S. ad block users said they use the tool to prevent interruptions by ads.\nSo how do you sell to people who aren\u2019t interested in being sold to?\nAt 23 Stories, the content marketing arm of Cond\u00e9 Nast, it comes down to a combination of audience data and editorial insight that other advertising agencies don\u2019t have access to.\n\u201cWe have direct access to millions of consumers, so we have both a much deeper understanding of what content resonates with different demographics and also the ability to distribute the content we create at scale,\u201d Josh Stinchcomb, managing director of 23 Stories, tells Folio:.\nAt Cond\u00e9 Nast, where Stinchcomb says branded content makes up 15 percent of advertising revenues, one campaign can be tailored to fit the voice of any or all of the publisher\u2019s 22 titles. One such campaign with Chevy included over 70 pieces across six different magazines.\nA native video produced by Glamour showed singer Michael Bubl\u00e9 surprise a fan with a ride in a Chevy Malibu. The 2 minute and 46 second video generated 11 million minutes of consumption online, and 120,000 social actions.\n\u201cDetermine what role you play for consumers and then make your partners an additive part of that experience,\u201d Stinchcomb says.\nScott mirrors Stinchcomb\u2019s sentiment, saying that effective content marketing involves leveraging your editorial niche. But that doesn\u2019t mean magazine marketing services need to keep content at their publication. Onion Labs creates content across client channels, from broadcast and radio, to other digital outlets.\n\u201cEssentially, clients can leverage our creative and production services, then use our content to run on any of their media channels,\u201d Scott says.\nThis can include partnerships with social media companies, who are often charged with taking away ad revenues from hungry publishers. Onion Labs is partnered with Facebook Anthology to create native-style ads with data insights provided by Facebook\u2019s own in-house creative team, the Creative Shop.\nIn one campaign for Progressive Insurance, Onion Labs created a fake TV network called the Grown Up Network. Using Facebook Anthology, they targeted the ads specifically at people who have posted on the social network about a big life change.\nJust as Onion Labs promises to give clients access to its niche audience, native partnerships with Facebook allow for unparalleled insight into the Facebook audience \u2014 all within the attractive narrative package of editorial at The Onion.\nCan you provide examples of how Onion Labs creates content across various client channels, and how do they work with social media companies such as Facebook?",

Everyone was inside hiding from the storm, except for one brave young student, who ventured outside to experience the harsh conditions. As they walked, they noticed that their glasses, which had become an integral part of their identity, were nowhere to be found. After a frantic search, they realized that their glasses must have dropped off somewhere in the dark rain. With no choice, the student began a journey, one that may lead them far, in hopes of finding their lost glasses. \n\nThe student trekked through dense forests, climbing up hills and braving treacherous rivers in search of something that now seemed so distant. Several days passed and their hope was starting to fade. But then, one fateful afternoon, their eyes caught a glimmer in the corner of their vision. They rushed towards the source, and to their surprise, it was their glasses. The student was overjoyed to find them, and they knew they would never be as careless with their glasses ever again. \n\nThe student thanked the storm for uniting them with their lost glasses, and continued on their journey, back home.\n\n\nBreak the text into two logical paragraphs.the meetings can be live or virtual, but with the pandemic continuing in many parts of the world, many companies will opt for virtual meetings in order to minimize the spread of illness. virtual meetings also bring an array of advantages like being able to connect with people in different parts of the world.",
