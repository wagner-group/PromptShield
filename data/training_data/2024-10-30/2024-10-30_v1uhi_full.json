Just as a painting or a sculpture can shape and provoke emotions, so can a video game. Video games allow us to think, feel, and interact with our environment in ways that no other medium can and deserve to be respected as a form of art. \n\nVideo games create immersive experiences and give players the freedom to explore and make choices in a virtual world. By engaging in these experiences, players can process difficult aspects of their lives and work through them in a safe and controlled environment. This can help players develop their emotional intelligence and understanding of human relationships in a way that no other form of art can offer.\n\nVideo games have had a massive influence in shaping popular culture and have made a profound impact on society. It has been argued that video games have become even more influential than classic art forms like painting, sculpture and theatre in terms of their reach, engagement and impact. Just as classic art forms are fundamental for understanding culture and its values, video games are an important form of expression that can allow us to take a step back and reflect on our lives and the world we live in.\n\nVideo games should be treated like any other form of art and not be seen as a purely recreational activity\u2014they are so much more than that.

Those locations are the stores at 127 Cape Coral Parkway and 2420 Santa Barbara Blvd.\nDonors will receive a $10 Publix Gift Card along with a wellness check-up of blood pressure, pulse, temperature and iron count, including a cholesterol screening.\nMeanwhile, the blood banks associated with the Lee Memorial Health System are always in need of additional units of all blood types.\nBlood is needed for numerous medical procedures, not only for crash victims, but for surgeries and various treatments. Fewer post-season donors mean less available stock and, sometimes, communitywide appeals for certain blood types.\nAlmost anyone can donate blood and most medications do not preclude one from baring an arm.\nBlood donors just have to weigh at least 115 pounds; be 17 years old or older (16 with parental consent) and have a photo ID if new to the donor process.\nThe procedure is fairly quick, relatively painless - and it save lives.\nJust one donation can help three patients in need because it can be separated into components - red blood cells, plasma and platelets.\nIf you can spare a few minutes this spring or summer, we urge you to take part.\nHere in the Cape, blood donations can be made at Cape Coral Hospital, 636 Del Prado Blvd., Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, 8 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. and Tuesdays 8 a.m. - 7 p.m.\nn Lee Memorial Hospital 2776 Cleveland Ave. Fort Myers, 33901 Phone: 239-343-2333 Hours: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, & Friday 8 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. Thursday 8 a.m. - 7 p.m.\nn Summerlin Crossings 15880 Summerlin Road, Suite 113 Fort Myers, 33908 Phone: 239-437-5061 Hours: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, & Friday 8 a.m. - 4:30 p.m. Wednesday 8 a.m. - 7 p.m.\nn Bonita Community Health Center 3501 Health Center Blvd., Suite 2011 Bonita Springs, 34135 Phone: 239-495-4372 Hours: Monday - Friday 8 a.m. - 4 p.m.\nThere also is the convenience of having the Lee Memorial Blood Mobile come to you.\nThe center provides everything a business or organization needs to host a blood drive.",

The chef will also be built in entertainment for your guests, who will watch and learn some great tips.\n\u2022 If you are having a small group, fondue is a fun choice. You can also do this with a larger group, just make sure to have enough pots and seating for all.\n\u2022 \"Stir up\" a delicious punch for your guests.\n\u2022 Go from gourmet cooking theme page, back to Bridal Shower Ideas For You homepage.

As populations increase and resources become scarce, there is a danger that food waste could become an even bigger issue, leading to resource scarcity and an increase in global hunger. A large amount of food production in different countries is wasted due to inadequate storage and harvesting techniques, improper transport, and improper waste management. All of these factors contribute to the growing food waste problem, leading to increased food insecurity, resource depletion, and environmental destruction. \n\nApart from this, food waste is also leading to unsustainable farming practices and considerable losses in the supply chain. This is particularly worrying, as it accelerates the destruction of vital ecosystems and habitats, leading to decreased biodiversity and greater climate change. As such, it is essential that we take action to reduce food waste and shift towards more sustainable farming and food production practices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***user task***:\nOops, belay that order.

        "instruction": "Given the text: Gov. Jeff Colyer on Wednesday signed an executive order banning state agencies from asking job-seekers about their criminal history during the initial phase of the hiring process. Commonly referred to as a \"ban the box\" initiative, because it eliminates the question from the job application form, Colyer's order gives agencies 90 days to update their practices. Surrounded by Republican and Democratic lawmakers, the governor said those with criminal convictions deserve an opportunity to explain what happened before they are automatically disqualified for a position. He said offenders who are able to find gainful employment lead better lives and become full members of the community. \"The true character of any Kansan is measured by how we respond to adversity, and the work that they put in to make their lives better, and the lives around them,\" Colyer said. \"I think that is a great opportunity and a lesson for all of us.\" Colyer praised businesses like Walmart, Home Depot and Koch Industries, as well as cities like Topeka, who already have adopted \"ban the box\" policies. T.D. Hicks, pastor of Antioch Missionary Baptist Church in Topeka, said he expects the order to have a significant impact by leveling the playing for people seeking access to state government jobs in the capital city. \"This is an issue that individuals face often on a daily basis,\" Hicks said. \"They\u2019re released from jail, then they get back in the jail that society has created, having to check this box.\" Lawmakers who joined Colyer for the announcement praised him for his leadership. \"When I mentioned it to some people that Gov. Colyer is bringing 'ban the box' to reality,\" said Rep. Gail Finney, D-Wichita, \"everybody\u2019s like, 'Gov. Colyer\u2019s doing what?' And I\u2019m like, 'Yes!' Kudos to the governor. Senate President Susan Wagle, R-Wichita, said she hoped the order would lead to passage of a statewide law. \"It\u2019s the right thing to do,\" Wagle said. \"As a faith-based nation and a faith-based state, we believe in giving everyone an opportunity. And we believe in forgiveness, and we believe in new beginnings and fresh starts.\" Colyer said 30 other states have adopted \"ban the box\" policy, and giving offenders a foot in the door can help reduce recidivism by nearly 50 percent. In Kansas City, Kan., the policy has led to city government hiring a handful of people with convictions in the past two years, said the city's mayor, David Alvey. \"If we really get into the experience of those who\u2019ve been in prison, they want out,\" Alvey said. \"And they want out, beyond out of prison. They want to make a life. And this is an opportunity for them to make a life for themselves, for their family, for their neighborhood.\" How does Governor Colyer's executive order give offenders a foot in the door and help reduce recidivism by nearly 50%?",

Air Engineers Service Experts Heating & Air Conditioning can help you choose a system that will meet your needs and fit with your budget.\nHowever, heating and air conditioning systems themselves aren\u2019t the sole costs. There are some added costs through the installation process that several people forget about.\nMost of us rely heavily on our heating and air conditioning system to keep us at the right temperature all year long. So, it makes sense that you would like a reliable and qualified professional to install and maintain your system. Technicians go through special training and certifications and are consistently keeping up with the latest in HVAC systems.

Effective maintenance and repair also involves additional tools and supplies to do the job.\nSaving money is always nice, but you also don\u2019t want to skimp on valuable service. To help save costs, keep your eye out throughout the year for special promotions that you can take advantage of.\nIf you are shopping for a new HVAC system, or if your existing equipment needs repairs or routine maintenance, our team is here to help.

        "instruction": "Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material\n\nQuestion/Instruction: According to analyst Eugen Weinberg, how has the recent weakness in the dollar contributed to the rally in gold prices?\n\nGiven material: Spot gold prices pushed above a psychological threshold of $1,300 a troy ounce on Monday, buoyed by a weak dollar and investment inflows. Gold rose to $1,302.13 a troy ounce, up 0.7% from the previous close. The precious metal had hovered close to the psychological mark earlier this year, but failed to gather enough momentum as profit-taking set in. The recent weakness in the dollar has combined with investment inflows to give gold an extra push, said Eugen Weinberg, analyst at Commerzbank. Gold usually has an inverse correlation with the dollar, the currency in which it is priced internationally. A weaker dollar usually makes gold cheaper to buy for consumers outside of U.S., in countries such as China and India. The dollar weakened at the end of last week following the decision by the Bank of Japan to keep monetary policy unchanged as well as disappointing first-quarter gross domestic product out of the U.S. However, the rally in gold could come under renewed pressure as safe-haven demand for the metal is waning and equity markets are in better shape, says Mr. Weinberg. Analysts say the key factor that will determine the direction of gold prices is any indication from the U.S. Federal Reserve on when it might shift monetary policy and tighten rates. Prices of silver also rose strongly in line with gold. Spot silver rose to an intra-day high of $17.936 a troy ounce, before edging down to $17.88 a ounce, 0.4% higher than the previous close. Analysts say silver&apos;s fundamentals might be stronger than gold as the white metal often doubles up as an industrial metal. In recent weeks, industrial metals such as copper have gained strongly on signs of better demand from China.",

SEMrush generously compiled and shared 1,400,000 featured snippets from their database for us to analyze.\nThe optimal length of a featured snippet paragraph is about 40 to 50 words(~around 300 characters).\nWhat it means is that, for higher chances to get featured, aim at answering teh question within 40-50 words.\nThe average number of items in a list was four, but that number is not what we should focus on. Instead, focus on the maximum number of items in the list. This prompts Google to display the \u201cMore Items\u2026\u201d text, which can lead to better engagement.\nSame with tables: For longer tables Google will invite the user to click to see more items in a table.\nMoreover, tables give you huge competitive advantage because Google loves them but not too many publishers use them. So create more comparison tables!\nBetween January 16 and January 17, 2016, Getstat gathered the top 100 ranking URLs for one million high-CPC keywords.\nGreat post Ann! \ud83d\ude42 I was wondering, is it true that we get more chance if our content consists more of bullet forms and tables?\nAmazing studies! I\u2019m excited to see what will change in 1 year or so, considering the pace of FS today.\nI would also recommend the featured snippets study from StoneTemple.\nCan you summarize the key findings from the Ghergich & Co. and SEMrush study on featured snippets?",

Also, missing properties are only picked up when the application is running, not at compile time.\nAnd avoid stored procedures completely if you can.

        "instruction": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: In what ways do Muslims today differ from their ancestors in responding to religious affronts?\n\nPassage: Protests against the Danish Mohammed cartoons in 2006 Photo: Copyright (c) 2006 Rex Features. No use without permission.\nSoon after the terrorist attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, Islamist sympathisers on social media unleashed familiar rhetoric using Arabic language hashtags such as \u201cour revenge for the messenger (Muhammad)\u201d; \u201cParis is Burning\u201d; and \u201cParis under Fire\u201d .\nSuch bombast reflects the emptiness of the Islamist dream. The killing of 12 unarmed cartoonists and journalists is hardly an act of courage. Paris did not, in fact, burn and this latest act of terrorism mobilised the French against the Jihadis just as terrorist attacks in New York, London and Mumbai had united people against them in the past.\nMore important, terrorism is unlikely to dissuade anyone so inclined to refrain from insulting Islam, its Prophet or Muslims. Like followers of any other religion, Muslims do not like insults to their faith or to their prophet. But threats and actual attacks of the type witnessed in Paris last week have been limited to Islamists.\nContrary to the assertion of some, such violence has nothing to do with recent wars or the policies of great powers in Iraq, Afghanistan or Syria. A man named Alam Din from Lahore was proclaimed a \u201cghazi\u201d \u2013 or warrior \u2013 for killing a Hindu publisher of a book insulting Prophet Muhammad in 1929. Salman Rushdie\u2019s Satanic Verses prompted fatwas and provoked violent protests 50 years later, in 1989. These incidents cannot be attributed, for example, as reaction to US military intervention.\nWhat if this isn't about cartoons?\nOf course, not all of the world\u2019s more than one billion Muslims react to real or perceived insults to their religion in the same manner. Believers in different deities and prophets have often slandered each other\u2019s faiths. Islam has endured its share of criticism and abuse over the centuries, especially from Christians, against whom they fought for control of the Levant and the southern corners of Europe during the Crusades and the Ottoman wars.\nBut in earlier times, Muslims responded to religious affronts by pointing out the flaws in other religions and outlining their own perfect faith. Muslim armies were violent but then so were the armies of others. The association of extremism and terrorism with Muslims is a phenomenon mostly of the modern era.\nWhen Muslim emperors ruled over large non-Muslim populations, Muslim preachers and Sufi mystics worked to proselytise and win converts to Islam. There is no record in those days of mob violence or targeted attacks against foreign envoys or traders in retaliation for blasphemy against Prophet Muhammad or Islam allegedly committed by Islam\u2019s enemies in distant lands.\nThe phenomenon of violent outrage and killing over insults to Islam and its final prophet seems to have started during Western colonial rule, with Muslim politicians seeking issues to mobilise their constituents. Contemporary Jihadism seems to have grown out of the slogan \u201cIslam in Danger\u201d, which has been periodically invoked as a rallying cry for Islamist politics.\nIronically, it is the Islamists who draw attention to otherwise obscure attacks on Islam and then use those attacks to muster popular support. The reaction makes more people aware of a book like Rushdie\u2019s, a YouTube film such as The Innocence of Muhammad or cartoons in small circulation satirical magazines. Charlie Hebdo usually published only 45,000 copies; now it will be read by hundreds of thousands, if not millions.\nThe violence over \u201cIslam\u2019s honour\u201d is a function of the collective Muslim narrative of grievance. Decline, weakness, impotence, and helplessness are phrases most frequently repeated in the speeches and writings of today\u2019s Muslim leaders. The view is shared by Islamists \u2013 who consider Islam a political ideology \u2013 and other Muslims who don\u2019t. The terrorists are just the most extreme element among the Islamists.\nAs a community, Muslims are obsessed with their past pre-eminence, which stands in stark contrast to their current weakness. The bravado of beheading \u201cblasphemers\u201d and thinking that a terrorist attack can change the global order are ways of reclaiming a glory that is vividly recalled but has not been seen by Muslims in recent centuries.\nLike all national and community narratives, the current Muslim narrative has some elements of truth. But it is equally true that Muslims have made practically no serious effort to understand the causes and remedies of their decline over the past 300 years. Outrage, resentment and violence \u2014 and the conspiracy theories that inform them \u2014 serve as palliatives for an Ummah (or global Muslim community) that reads little, writes even less, has not invented much in recent centuries, is economically less productive than comparable peoples and wields little political or military power in the contemporary world. Dealing with the causes of Muslim decline, not random or orchestrated acts of terrorism, would be the real way forward in saving Muslims from dishonour.",

        "instruction": "\"One great trouble with the Christmas business,\" remarked the Nebraska State Journal of December 24, 1892, \"is the habit formed by the great unthinking public of waiting until the last minute to put the packages into the post office. Now and then you find level-headed people who begin ten days before Christmas and drop carefully packed presents into the office in time to go through in good order before the rush commences. But these folks are the exception.\n\"Madame Grundy figures that the express trains go to the Atlantic coast in two days and to the Pacific in four days, and moves herself according to that schedule. She loads herself with bundles and applies at the window for stamps two or three days before Christmas, and then what a riot there is my countrymen! The office is gorged, the mail cars are swamped, and everybody connected with the [postal] service is in a fever of unrest to put the stuff in motion. The result is that flimsy pasteboard boxes that ought not to have been entrusted to the mails are smashed flat, addresses are lost, and the bulk of the presents cannot be delivered until a day or two after Christmas. . . .\n\"The rush this year in the Lincoln office has been unprecedented. For two days the packages have been pouring through the front windows in a Niagara of Christmas cheer. 'We have never seen anything like it,' said George Root, who has been guarding the stamp window for the past few days, as he stopped a few minutes to breathe last evening.'There has been a procession of people here all the time with every kind of bundle you could think of.'\"\nPostal employees were said to be straining to handle the increased holiday mail. \"Two or three of them have already broken down and gone to bed. Life in the government service is not a picnic at any season of the year. While the world is enjoying the holidays it becomes a positive burden.\" The succeeding Journal on December 25 noted the introduction in St. Louis of a \"street railway car\" equipped for mail pickup, processing, and delivery to help expedite mail service in that city. Can you provide more details about the introduction of a \"street railway car\" for mail pickup and delivery in St. Louis during the holiday season?",

As they walked, they noticed that their glasses, which had become an integral part of their identity, were nowhere to be found.

With no choice, the student began a journey, one that may lead them far, in hopes of finding their lost glasses. \n\nThe student trekked through dense forests, climbing up hills and braving treacherous rivers in search of something that now seemed so distant. Several days passed and their hope was starting to fade. But then, one fateful afternoon, their eyes caught a glimmer in the corner of their vision. They rushed towards the source, and to their surprise, it was their glasses. The student was overjoyed to find them, and they knew they would never be as careless with their glasses ever again. \n\nThe student thanked the storm for uniting them with their lost glasses, and continued on their journey, back home.\n\n\nBreak the text into two logical paragraphs.the meetings can be live or virtual, but with the pandemic continuing in many parts of the world, many companies will opt for virtual meetings in order to minimize the spread of illness. virtual meetings also bring an array of advantages like being able to connect with people in different parts of the world.",

        "instruction": "The Tucson apartment market is experiencing a renaissance with active and innovative development in the sector after a decade of underinvestment. During the housing boom of 2000 to 2008 the economics of multifamily development allowed few new developments in Tucson. Due to low apartment rental rates, high cost of land and building materials, very few multifamily developments penciled out in Tucson during the past decade. Lower land and building costs, a weak home market, higher demand for quality multifamily housing and some key rezoning actions have brought on a flurry of new construction. There are numerous exciting new developments addressing different segments of the multifamily market. Proposed downtown developments including The Gadsden Company\u2019s Monier and West End Station projects and Holualoa\u2019s redevelopment of The Herbert are midrise urban living projects and will answer the need for more housing downtown and contribute to the growth and vitality of downtown Tucson. Alta Vista Communities' AERIE product of rental casitas is a more private higher end product than the traditional two and three story garden style property and offers a product for those that may have bought entry level houses or townhomes in the past. HSL and MC Companies are also building quality new product with innovative floorplans attracting today\u2019s renters. Average rental rates for the new properties is in the $1.00 to $1.15 per square foot (psf) range, well above the $0.86 psf average rental rate for the market. Currently there are 1,770 units under construction and 2,454 units planned through the end of 2014. Of these, 933 units are student housing and 3,052 are market rate properties. The forecast is bright for Tucson\u2019s apartment market, thanks to the University of Arizona\u2019s continued growth, more people choosing to rent, and the need for quality rental housing in this marketplace. Tucson experienced underinvestment of new apartments for the ten years from 2003 through 2012 when only 4,512 units built. New construction is now compensating for the lack of development in the past decade and answering to an underserved market. Student housing is experiencing an equally if not more impressive transition with 537 units set for delivery this month and 977 units between August 2012 and August 2014. In August 2012 The District on 5th with 208 units opened and ushered in a new level of amenities and quality for student housing at the University of Arizona. August 2013 deliveries include Campus Acquisitions' 177 unit project called Level, Capstone's two downtown developments, Plaza Centro Railyard and Plaza Centro Greyhound, with 97 and 99 units each, and lastly Landmark Properties' The Retreat at Tucson with 164 units. August 2014 deliveries will include Campus Acquisitions Park Avenue apartments with 165 Units, CORE Campus\u2019s The Hub at Tucson with 164 units, and possibly The Junction at Iron Horse, a 67-unit property from Royal Properties. In addition to these developments there are other sites in play with possible deliveries in August 2015 and 2016. These 977 units and approximately 2,900 bedrooms will be a major influence on the student housing sector bringing previously unavailable high quality amenities and a higher quality living environment close to campus. Rental rates at the new properties will average in the range of $800 per bedroom and offer amenities including exercise rooms, rooftop pools, tanning beds, study lounges and more. The addition of these properties off the modern rail car and in the Main Gate District will bring a higher concentration of students closer to campus and will most likely pull students from the student housing properties further away from campus. While the amount of new construction may seem high, market indicators are strong and indicate that there is demand in place to absorb the new properties. The multifamily market has absorbed approximately 1,000 units each of the past four years and just experienced a rare positive absorption for the second quarter of 2013. With average occupancy for stabilized properties built since 2010 at 92.5%, with the local economy gaining momentum, and rising interest rates making home ownership less affordable, the future looks bright for new multifamily development in Tucson. Bob Kaplan joined Cushman & Wakefield | PICOR in October 2006 after five years with Bourn Partners LLC, where he earned the top sales producer position in 2004 and 2005. Bob focuses his work on the brokerage of multifamily investments serving the needs of local, regional, and national apartment owners and investors. He can be reached at 520.546.2737 or via email at bkaplan@picor.com. What factors have contributed to the recent increase of multifamily development in Tucson, and what are the implications for the local economy and housing market?",

This was relatively straightforward, but required a little bit of finesse, with two aliases I needed to set up in OSX.\nThis will connect to your instance securely, and listen locally for traffic, on the port you specify. This traffic will be forwarded on to your instance.\nWhile I'm running Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (Precise Pangolin), this should work across a lot of different linux versions, I would imagine.\nI only want to use this connection with Netflix or when I'm using public Wi-Fi, so I want to be able to activate and close it on a whim.\nWhen I exit out of the ssh-connection, it sometimes hangs, and I need to press Ctrl-C to actually have it exit. But a problem persists: you've set-up a proxy in your Network settings (albeit, through step 2 above via CLI), which then stops your traffic (since the connection can no longer be made).\nThis turns off the SOCKS proxy for your \"Wi-fi\" connection.\nNow, when I want to connect, I simply run vpn-on from my command line.\nWhen I'm done, I press Ctrl-C, and then issue the vpn-off command.\nThe port you use above doesn't matter a whole-lot. It doesn't need to be open in your instance's security group, since they are local ports.\nA couple posts that guided me in the right direction were Forward trafic from secure VPN (ipsec) to PPTP, which suggested an alternative to PPTP (which I was doing before), and How to change proxy setting using Command line in Mac OS?, which helped me with the CLI command for changing my OSX network-settings.

        "instruction": "Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material\n\nQuestion/Instruction: How does the Golf Channel differentiate itself from other single-sport networks like the Tennis Channel or the NFL, NHL, NBA, and MLB networks?\n\nGiven material: In praise of the Golf Channel and its amazing embrace of golf minutiae.\nMorning shows about golf. Talk shows about golf. Reality shows about golf. The Golf Channel has it figured out.\nHosts on the set of Morning Drive.\nThis week, the Golf Channel will broadcast 70 hours of television from the Masters tournament in Augusta, Ga. There\u2019ll be news conferences, feature stories, highlight packages, shot analysis. Everything but live play. The Golf Channel doesn\u2019t have the rights to televise this or any of the men\u2019s majors, but that won\u2019t stop it from covering the tournament from dawn to dusk.\nI\u2019ve never played a round of golf that didn\u2019t involve tiny windmills, and the only time I look at golf coverage on the sports pages is to admire the argyles and plus fours. Yet after a week of watching the Golf Channel, I\u2019m a convert\u2014not to the sport, but to the channel\u2019s celebration of full-on, no-holds-barred, nothing-too-nerdy, knowledge-dropping expertise, packaged in familiar, cozy TV formats. Tune in at any time of day or night, and you\u2019re likely to find a program you recognize: morning show, talk show, news magazine, reality contest, late-night chat fest. They\u2019re just all about golf.\nWhether the discussions happen around the anchor desk or in the comfy chairs of the conversation pit, Morning Drive segments are long and nerdy. Spending several days with the Golf Channel reminded me of an immersion language course\u2014with no translation of stats like GIR or of obscure PGA policies on player pairings, there were times when I felt utterly lost, but I still felt invested in passionate debates about putting techniques.\nThe only time Morning Drive abandons the world of golf is when the host throws to a CNBC anchor for a brief market report. It\u2019s as though the channel is telling its viewers, \u201cWe know you\u2019re all titans of industry,\u201d but the update is so superficial\u2014a quick check on the Dow and the NASDAQ and a preview of the day ahead\u2014that it couldn\u2019t possibly serve any purpose other than flattery. Still, the audience is decidedly upscale: The Golf Channel, which broke its own ratings records in 2012, attracts an audience that skews old and male, and the network\u2019s tight targeting clearly appeals to advertisers. Even in the middle of the day or the early hours of the morning, the commercials are the classy kind every network dreams of, pushing cars, banks, hotels, resorts, and all manner of golf gear.\nAlthough the Golf Channel doesn\u2019t have the Masters, it televises more live golf than all other U.S. networks combined, men\u2019s and and women\u2019s tournaments from all over the world. Fortunately for the channel, golf is a sport that for all intents and purposes has no offseason. Less conveniently, tournaments run Thursday through Sunday, which leaves a three-day gap in the TV schedule.\nThat\u2019s where the instructors, talkers, and wannabes come in. Early in the week, tournament play gives way to Feherty, an interview show hosted by TV analyst David Feherty (he reckons himself a comedian, but trust me, he\u2019s just \u201cgolf funny\u201d); The Haney Project: Michael Phelps, in which a \u201clegendary swing coach\u201d tries to help the swimmer improve his golf game (in previous seasons Hank Haney has worked with Rush Limbaugh, Charles Barkley, and Ray Romano); and In Play With Jimmy Roberts, in which the guy who used to gum up NBC\u2019s Olympics coverage with sappy sob stories does the same thing to the Golf Channel. These programs are the rare cases when the channel\u2019s long leash feels like a problem: An hourlong show requires Feherty to mug for the camera between interview segments in a naked attempt to eat up minutes, and Phelps is a bore who spends most of the hour making excuses for his failure to practice. More successful is Big Break, a reality competition that will enter its 19th cycle in May. The format of immunity challenges and elimination will be familiar to anyone who\u2019s watched Project Runway or Top Chef. In this case, the contestants are fighting for the chance to play in a pro tournament, and astonishingly, several Big Break alumnae are now regulars on the PGA and LPGA tours, including Tommy \u201cTwo Gloves\u201d Gainey, who won a PGA Tour event in 2012.\nOf course, there are other single-sport networks, but the Golf Channel is part of my basic cable package, while the Tennis Channel and the NFL, NHL, NBA, and MLB networks are premium options that only the already obsessed would shell out for. And it\u2019s the Golf Channel\u2019s mind-blowing commitment to minutiae that turns me green with envy. Round-the-clock news channels are all over the dial, but because they\u2019re gunning for a general audience, they stick to the superficial. Those of us interested in international affairs, public policy, or television have to settle for point-counterpoint arguments and slick two-minute feature stories, while what we really want is the hard-news equivalent of the Golf Channel\u2019s in-depth, technical discussions. It\u2019s so unfair, I\u2019m tempted to organize a protest\u2014just as soon as the Masters is over. It\u2019s just that Padraig Harrington has been tinkering with his swing again, Rory McIlroy seems to be adjusting to his new clubs, and did you see Jim Furyk\u2019s final shot at the Valero Texas Open?",

It\u2019s like it\u2019s only consumed in restaurants as it\u2019s just not one of those things people make in their own kitchen. I don\u2019t know why though because it is so so sooo easy.\nHeat it, stir it, serve it. Bam. Delicious, satisfying, soul warming food.\nWhat people also don\u2019t seem to know is that you can make it from fresh corn too. I actually prefer \u2018fresh\u2019 polenta vs. that made traditionally with dried corn. Fresh corn makes a much more flavorful, and unsurprisingly fresh-tasting polenta. Also, it seems to be better at holding moisture, as normal polenta can get dry pretty quickly, especially when reheating. Making it with fresh corn is still super easy, and it\u2019s pretty cool to transform whole ears of corn into a pot of spoonable amazingness.\nI recently moved to Colorado and have noticed people are quite fond of their chiles here. In particular, the favorite seems to be the Pueblo chile. It is a medium heat pepper with pretty thick flesh that makes it excellent for roasting. It\u2019s also great balanced out with contrasting rich, salty cheese. Chiles + cheese is a favorite and comforting classic combo in Mexico and this region of the US.\nThis fresh polenta is such a lovely way to highlight that flavor friendship, as well as some very seasonal produce. If you don\u2019t have access to Pueblo chiles, poblanos would make a decent substitute. Or, if you aren\u2019t into capsaicin, you could just go for some sweet bell peppers. Try for a little spice though. It rounds out the other cheesy, corny, creamy, rich features of this dish. Serve alongside a grilled protein and fresh veggies, and you got yourself one super fresh, summery, and balanced meal.\nHusk the corn and remove as many of silks as you can. Put a small bowl upside down in a large bowl. Stand up an ear of corn on the small bowl and cut down the sides to shave off the kernels. Cut all the way to the cob to get as much corn as you can. Repeat with all ears.\nIn a medium pot, add the kernels with 2 cups water and the \u00bd tsp. salt. Cover, and place on high heat. When it comes to a boil, reduce heat to bring to a simmer and let cook covered for 10 minutes.\nRemove from heat and use an immersion/stick blender to blend the corn in the pot. (You could also ladle the soup into a blender to puree it. An immersion blender is an amazing, versatile tool to own, and I highly suggest getting one if you don\u2019t have one yet) Blend until pretty smooth, but still with some chunks. Place back on the stove and bring back to a simmer. Cook, stirring every few minutes to prevent sticking to the bottom, for about 20 minutes, or until thickened. Careful! Hot polenta is angry polenta! (It will spit at you) How long you cook the polenta depends on how you like it. Cook longer and it will be drier, shorter and it will be more soupy. When done, turn off heat and stir in the cheddar and a few grinds black pepper.\nWhile the polenta is cooking, cut the peppers into small chunks. Heat a saut\u00e9 pan on medium heat. When hot, add the 1 tsp. oil and the peppers. Season with salt and cumin if you have it on hand. Cook, moving occasionally, until peppers are very tender and are blistered.\nServe polenta hot, topped with some of the peppers and a little more cheddar if you like. Extras can be stored for a few days in the fridge. Just reheat with a little liquid.\nNotes: You can really do as you please in terms of the peppers. If you don\u2019t like spice, use two bell peppers. If you like things hot, use a couple chiles. If you like polenta a little creamier, stir in 2 tbs. cream or half and half with the cheese.",

        "instruction": "[By Nick] With the limited edition flavors out of the way, we can finally take a look at Homemade Brand\u2019s normal rotation. Besides Vanilla and Chocolate, nothing is more commonplace in an ice cream company\u2019s line up than Cookies N\u2019 Cream so I\u2019m glad Homemade sent me a pint of their version to try. Now where most companies fail when it comes to cookies n\u2019 cream ice cream is the cookies component. They tend to lean towards using generic \u201cchocolate sandwich cookies\u201d instead of real deal Oreos.\nHomemade Brand doesn\u2019t mess around and prominently displays that their ice cream is made with genuine Oreo cookies. According to their websites\u2019 description, they use whole Oreo cookies and mix them into their Madagascar vanilla ice cream. I\u2019m not sure if that means they actually just throw whole cookies in or break them up beforehand but hey I guess that\u2019s the whole point of reviewing products. As for the base, I\u2019m happy to see them using a vanilla bean base over the homemade vanilla ice cream I tried earlier. Something about vanilla bean ice cream is just more appealing to me.\nTaking off the lid, you can see that they do break up the cookies before mixing them in. Homemade Brand has nailed the perfect color you\u2019d want to see in a cookies n\u2019 cream ice cream. Taking my first bite, I was struck with a bit of nostalgia. This ice cream reminded me of the Breyers version from my childhood; you know before they went and ruined it. This is the textbook definition of what cookies and cream is.\nThere are bits of Oreos everywhere as well as a good amount of chunks. When I say chunks I\u2019m talking about the size of a nickel which adds to the textural experience. The Madagascar vanilla is the perfect canvas for this flavor. It\u2019s delicate and mild, allowing for the flavor of the Oreo cookies to truly shine through. While this is a very delicious ice cream, it still doesn't quite dethrone Ben & Jerry\u2019s Milk & Cookies. If you\u2019re looking for a good old fashioned Cookies N\u2019 Cream though, this flavor is definitely for you. Can you compare Homemade Brand's Cookies N' Cream ice cream to Breyers?",

To suit myself -Basically, I can't play an instrument or play any music, always been too lazy, but I reckon I could have a good go at writing. I understand the basics and that is it. I want to have a dabble at making some stuff in the same vein as tangerine dream, john carpenter, kraftwerk etc... just to see if it can be d0ne by an idiot such as myself. Audacity is pretty basic but does what it says on the tin and can be downloaded for free!!! There are some cheap hardware options too, e.g. pick up a cheap synth with rhythm presets. You can probably get an Alesis Micron or Akai Miniak for next to sod all these days. They've got loads of TD/Carpenter/Kraftwerk type rhythm presets, and sounds to go with them. You can play 'em out of the box, in about five minutes. Plug 'em into Audacity and you're laughing. Once you get pissed off at the limitations of the presets you can start delving a bit deeper. They're kind of the same machine in different boxes (up to a point). I had loads of fun with mine. There's loads and loads of free software stuff out there too. Follow Brian Eno on Twitter. He's forever tweeting stuff about free online synth emulators. You don't have to be a genius to route that into a recording application. I like hardware; other people like software. Nobody's right or wrong. The great thing is that these days, you don't have to spend huge \u00a3\u00a3\u00a3 to get started. You can have a dabble for not very much money (or free!) and you can figure out what you like best. Just have fun with it. Mess about and see what you like.

The force F in Newton of the airflow can be calculated by using the equation F=A\u00d7P, where A is the area of the tube and P is the pressure. The area of the tube is given by the formula A=\u03c0r2, thus we have A=\u03c0\u00d72 cm2 = 12.57 cm2. To calculate the pressure, the equation P=(mass/time)\u00d7density is used. In this case, the pressure is given by P=0.5 kg/sec\u00d71.3 kg/m3 = 0.65 kg/m3 = 0.65 N/m2. The total force of the airflow is then calculated as F=A\u00d7P=12.57 cm2 \u00d7 0.65 N/m2 = 8.17 N.

Over time, this leads to the development of new species which are better suited to the environment. Artificial selection, on the other hand, involves humans directly selecting which organisms are able to reproduce. Unlike natural selection, this is a conscious decision where humans selectively choose which organisms gain reproductive advantages. This is done in order to produce organisms with a desired trait or characteristic, such as larger fruits or better yields. Both natural and artificial selection are important processes that have allowed us to shape the world and its organisms as we know it.\n\n\nGenerate a date-focused sentence that uses comparative words and suits the input.june 1st is just around the corner.",

Answer according to: Excerpted with permission from An Indomitable Beast: The Remarkable Journey of the Jaguar, by Alan Rabinowitz. Copyright \u00a9 Island Press, 2014.\nWhat I had seen in my work with the tiger made me worry all the more about the jaguar. Fortunately the jaguar\u2019s situation, while deteriorating in many areas through hunting and loss of habitat, was not yet close to that of its larger cousins, the tiger and the lion. But that could change quickly, as the supply of tiger bone was diminishing and the insatiable demand turning to the parts of other big cats\u2014lions, jaguars, and leopards. My other concern was that the research and conservation of jaguars that I had thought would follow my work in Belize and that of other early jaguar researchers had not happened to any great extent. The jaguar preserve in Belize was plodding along, a few more people were working on jaguars in different parts of their range, but 15 years after setting up the preserve, we didn\u2019t seem to know much more about the life of this cat or even its distribution than when I had first started working on the species. And no one seemed concerned.\nBut part of the reason behind the writing of this book is that I still wanted more. After three decades of witnessing the continual declines in big cat populations worldwide, I wanted to understand what had brought the jaguar to the unique place it occupied in the carnivore conservation world. What biological, cultural, and political factors of the New World and the people who inhabited it allowed there to be a twenty-first-century range-wide jaguar corridor unlike anything else that existed with any other living big cat species? And as I gained a greater understanding of \u201cjaguarness,\u201d how the jaguar was indeed different from the other cats\u2014in structure, in temperament, and in behavior\u2014I also wanted to explain what seemed inexplicable, perhaps even unscientific. I wanted to understand the essence of the animal I had spent countless hours watching and talking to as a child, then following, studying, and fighting for as an adult. An essence that earlier people seemed to have seen and understood.",

He had always been a dreamer, imagining a life where he could be anything and do anything he wanted.\n\nOne night, as Jake lay in his bed, he heard a mysterious voice calling out his name. He looked around his bedroom, but there was no one there. Then he heard the voice again, begging him to follow it.\n\nFilled with curiosity and determination, Jake followed the voice, heading deeper and deeper into the forest. After what felt like hours of walking, he found himself in a clearing that seemed to shimmer in the moonlight. He heard the voice again, and it told him he had arrived at the wishing tree.\n\nJake gazed up at the ancient tree before him, and couldn't believe his eyes. The impossible had happened - it was a tree that grew coins, dollars, and even gems.\n\nUnable to believe his luck, Jake started filling his pockets with the precious items he found around the tree. But just as he was about to leave, a fierce creature stepped out of the darkness. \n\nJake scrambled away, only to find the creature had transformed into the mysterious voice he heard earlier. It turns out, the voice was actually a spell cast by an evil witch who was trying to trap people with her illusions. \n\nLuckily Jake was smart and brave, and he was able to outsmart the witch and escape with his life and treasures. From that day on, Jake's life was never the same again.\n\n\nDevelop an algorithm to categorize data according to provided labels.categorizing images as either a beach or an office.",

The two form a friendship and play together every evening. However, staying awake through the night starts to take its toll on Joe who can hardly keep his eyes open during the day.\nFor Christmas, Joe receives the gift of a night light which helps him get some peace and quiet from Moz and a good night's sleep. Just as viewers think the advert has come to a close, Joe turns the light back off and hears the familiar rumblings of his friend and is reminded that he can bring Moz back any time he thinks of him.\nMoz The Monster was created by advertising agency Adam&eveDDB and was directed by French director Michel Gondry, who is best known for his feature films Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Science of Sleep and The Green Hornet. He has also directed music videos for Bjork, Daft Punk, the White Stripes and the Rolling Stones, as well as a range of adverts including the award winning Levis Drugstore commercial.\nIn addition to watching the advert, people will be able to see and hear what's thought to be the world's first farting and snoring window at the John Lewis flagship store in London\u2019s Oxford Street as Moz plays in the rooms in Joe's house.\nIn addition, people will be able to have fun 'mozifying' their face on Facebook using their Facebook camera, and in 10 shops customers will be able to create their own monster selfie at a Monster Maker station.\nA recording of a reading of the Moz The Monster story by actress Sally Phillips will be available for download from the John Lewis website, Sky boxes and Google Home. Google Home customers will also be able to personalise their story choosing their own sounds effects.\nCan you provide a summary of John Lewis' 2017 Christmas advertising campaign and its associated activities?",

        "instruction": "Given the text: I was in my Preservation class last week, and we were talking about conservation; we had just visited the Preservation lab in Davis Library, and had talked about how to conserve general library materials. When we returned to the classroom, we started talking about conservation issues. We started talking about one bibliographer who was against any conservation measures; basically what he wants is for the book to naturally wear out through the course of its use. Apparently, any conservation measures prevent him from being able to do his research.\nWhile talking about this person\u2019s views, a member of my class said something to the effect of\u201dIsn\u2019t that the same as More Product, Less Process? Materials should just be used up without any preservation or conservation done on them.\u201d A friend of mine and I immediately said \u201cNo,\u201d but the conservation moved on.\nThe point of More Product, Less Process is not that materials should never have work done on them if they are in danger of being damaged. We actually had a good example of the MPLP mindset when we visited the preservation lab earlier that evening. The library staff used to take all new paperback books that they received and put library binding covers on them. Library binding covers are those solid color hardbacks that you often see in libraries. However, the preservation department recently changed their thinking on this. Instead of automatically binding every paperback book, they now put these paperbacks on the shelves and wait until there are signs that the book is being used before they bind it. If a book is not being used, it doesn\u2019t need to be bound; its just a waste of money, staff time, and resources.\nThe same principles come through in archives. While we know some collections will get a lot of use and therefore process them more intensely, not every collection is like that. And furthermore, not every part of a collection is going to the get same amount use. To just blanket process every collection at a predetermined level, whether that level be intensive or light, is foolhardy. Archivists should be looking at each collection and determining the correct level of processing for each part of that collection. Things taken into account are the expected amount of use, how much time the staff has, how \u201cimportant\u201d the collection is, and other things. But, if after it is processed, it gets more use, we can always go back and reprocess it. At UNC, the Technical Services and R&I staff work together closely; if the R&I staff finds that a collection needs more processing, the Technical Services staff can go back and reprocess it to suit the use.\nCan you explain the change in thinking regarding library binding covers in the preservation department?",

The escalation in violence followed an ISIL directive for affiliated armed groups to increase attacks during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.\nAt least 11 men in the village of Miringa were dragged from their homes by Boko Haram fighters on Friday and shot for escaping forced conscription by the group, residents said.\nBaballe Mohammed, a village resident, said the gunmen came to the village around 1:30 AM on Friday morning. They \"picked 13 men from selected homes and took them to the Eid prayer ground outside the village where they opened fire on them,\" he said, adding two managed to escape.\n\"The victims were well targeted because they were all residents of Gwargware village... who fled to Miringa some months ago to escape forced conscription by Boko Haram.\"\nIn another set of attacks on Thursday, two girls carrying explosives blew themselves up at a crowded market and a military checkpoint in Malari, outside the Borno state capital of Maiduguri, killing at least 13 people.\nThe violence on Thursday and Friday followed a series of attacks on Wednesday, when the group targeted mosques in the town of Kukawa, killing around 145 people as they prepared to break fast. Boko Haram often defiles mosques where it believes clerics espouse too moderate a form of Islam.\nAbbas Gava, spokesman for a regional vigilante group, said Boko Haram fighters also broke into people's homes in Kukawa, killing women and children.\nBoko Haram on Tuesday laid siege to the village of Mussaram, about 20 miles from Kukawa, killing another 48 men and boys.\nThe escalation in violence in northeast Nigeria, where Boko Haram has waged a six-year insurgency to create an Islamic caliphate, follows calls by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which the group pledged allegiance to earlier this year, to mar the holy month of Ramadan.\n\u201cMake it a month of disasters, defeats and disgrace for infidels everywhere,\u201d Abu Muhammad al-Adnani, an ISIL spokesman, reportedly said in an audio statement at the start of the month.\nBoko Haram has killed thousands of people and displaced about 1.5 million others since launching its insurgency in Africa's most populous nation and top oil producer.\nPresident Muhammadu Buhari, who was inaugurated on May 29, has held talks with officials from neighboring countries Chad, Niger, Cameroon and Benin to establish a regional force to tackle the armed group.",

        "instruction": "Given the text: European starling is a songbird that belongs to the family of starlings. It originates from Europe, but it can be found around the world today. European starling inhabits woodlands, cliffs, quarries, coastal areas, fields, agricultural areas, parks and gardens. Number of European starlings in the Europe is declining due habitat loss as a result of accelerated development of agriculture. Global population of European starlings is still large and stable and these birds are not on the list of endangered species.\nEuropean starling can reach 7.5 to 9.1 inches in length and 2 to 3.6 ounces of weight.\nEuropean starling is covered with black plumage with purple and green sheen. Black feathers with white tips can be seen during the autumn, creating mottled appearance. By the end of the winter, tips of the feathers become worn out and European starlings are once again completely black. Hatchlings are covered with grey-brown plumage. Young birds attain adult coloration quickly, but their head remains grey until they reach adulthood.\nColor of the bill depends on the season. European starling has yellow bill during the spring and black bill during the winter.\nEuropean starling has pointed bill, short wings and tail and pinkish-red legs.\nEuropean starling is an omnivore (it eats plants and meat). Its diet is based on the millipedes, spiders, snails and worms during the winter. Berries, seed, grains and fruit are major source of food during the summer.\nEuropean starling uses its beak to find food hidden in the soil.\nEuropean starling eliminates pest from the crops, but it also inflicts serious damage on the commercially important types of fruit.\nEuropean starling produces various unmusical songs that are composed of whistles, chuckles and rattling sounds. It can mimic songs of other birds and sound of human speech.\nEuropean starlings are gregarious birds that live in large flocks especially on the wintering grounds. Group of European starlings is known as \"constellation\", \"filth\" or \"scourge\" of starlings.\nLarge numbers of European starlings often congregate before the dusk near the roosting areas to sing, preen their plumage and to rest in the group.\nEuropean starlings produce two broods per season. They compete with native, cavity-nesting birds for the holes in the tree or for the abandoned nests of woodpeckers.\nBoth male and female participate in the construction of the nest. They use leaves, wool, feathers, moss and twigs to fill the interior of the cavity.\nFemale lays 5 to 7 bluish eggs in the second half of April. Both parents take part in the incubation of eggs (that lasts 15 days) and provide food for their chicks.\nYoung birds can fly at the age of 18 to 21 days, but they are not ready for the independent life at least one or two weeks.\nEuropean starling can survive more than 15 years in the wild.\nCan you provide a summary of the European starling, including its habitat, diet, and physical characteristics?",

        "instruction": "Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material\n\nQuestion/Instruction: Can you contrast the political goals and strategies of different groups within Algeria, including secular and Islamic parties, and analyze their prospects for success in achieving their objectives?\n\nGiven material: By M. Reza Behnam M. Reza Behnam, a political scientist, is director of the Institute for Advanced Middle Eastern Studies, Eugene, Ore.\nJUST a few days before Algeria was to celebrate the 30th anniversary of its independence from France, an assassin's bullet ended the life of Muhammad Boudiaf, and with it all festive preparations. Mr. Boudiaf had been a hero of the war for independence and was president of the five-member High State Committee that has ruled Algeria since January of this year. The violent removal of this old leader suggests that Algeria is not yet ready to celebrate its political identity, because the proper path to its e mergence as a modern, prosperous society has not been reconciled with the deep-seated Islamic ideals of its people.\nThirty years after Algeria gained its independence, the country continues to search for its political identity. Six months after a military-backed ruling council took control in January and quashed the Islamists rise to power, the country still faces the same grievous economic conditions and political uncertainties left behind by the rule of a single party, Front de Liberation (FLN).\nOver 130 years, generations of French known as pieds noirs (black feet) ruled Algeria, exploited its resources, built up its infrastructure and profited. But the nationalist revolt started in 1954, and in 1962 the Evian Agreement granted independence to the country.\nThe cost of victory was enormous. The war of liberation led by the FLN caused the death of some 250,000 Algerians and the wounding of 500,000. The final victory failed to erase the French imprint. The country has an Islamic culture coated with a French colonial veneer. During France's century-long \"civilizing\" campaigns, Algerians were reduced from relative prosperity to economic and cultural inferiority. Millions died, tribes broke up, and the traditional economy was altered. In particular, the producti on of wine for export in an Islamic land had replaced the traditional production of cereals.\nSince the war of liberation, Algerians have clamored for a democracy that will allow for the expression of their own political culture; like other colonized people, they have had to struggle to define their goals and the means to achieve them.\nWhile the FLN had deposed French rule, the state was run to create prosperity for the new elite, and it kept from power traditional political people believed to be reactionary. Pent-up discontent finally erupted into rioting at Algiers in early October 1988 and quickly spread to other cities. Over 500 people died when the armed forces opened fire on demonstrators at the capital. Discredited and its leadership demoralized, the FLN succumbed to political pluralism. About 50 political parties were formed.\nIn December 1991 the FLN was humiliated in parliamentary elections, winning only 17 seats compared to 188 seats for the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS). But the success of the Islamists was halted in mid-January when the Army called off a second round of elections and put the High State Committee in power. Within two months the FIS was banned, and party leaders either were imprisoned or took refuge underground.\nAlthough Algerians remain divided over the notion of an Islamic state, they have turned to their faith for political identity. Eighty percent of Algerians under 30 are unemployed. Ignored by the political system, the alienated generation turned to the mosques in their search for roots and for a political forum where opposition could be freely voiced.\nPeople blame the political system, past and present, for widespread corruption in government, inadequate housing, and a burgeoning black market. The government has been unable to reverse the reliance on food imports to a country which was once nearly self-sufficient in agricultural production and unable to lower a foreign debt estimated at nearly $26 billion.\nThe current leadership in the Maghreb countries, as in well as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Kuwait, are all concerned by the rise of Islam as a political force in the Middle East. Islamists' political victories in Algeria earlier this year arguably could have become a model for Islamic activism in other Arab Middle East countries.\nAlgeria faces many of the problems Iran experienced under the late shah - alienated youth, limited opportunity for social mobility, hopelessness in a world of shrinking resources. Iran, whose budding democracy movement was stifled in 1953, is an example that a society cannot ignore its problems for long without facing dramatic political results. The government of Algeria may be able to crush one movement or another, but they cannot crush the desire for reform forever.\nAlgerian activists are using Islam as a battle cry, saying they want democracy. It seems they want neither democracy nor a return to traditional culture, but desire a new synthesis that turns to traditional culture for political values and for a political forum or institution. However, the activists live in the modern world, and they want prosperity for the nation.\nIf politics is the art of compromise, it is advantageous to the present government to open the political system to allow participation by all Algerians. If allowed to participate, political parties will be tested in the political arena. Their active participation will help Algeria develop a political identity. The country needs to look to a new political synthesis whereby political identity and economic progress replace collapsed ideas and the quest for the spoils of the war of liberation, which have mar ked Algerian politics for the last 30 years.",

        "instruction": "Here is a piece of text: Epicor is joining the on-demand ERP (enterprise resource planning) fray with a new application aimed at small manufacturing companies as well as competing vendors such as NetSuite and SAP's Business ByDesign.\nLike NetSuite, Epicor Manufacturing Express Edition is fully multitenant SaaS (software as a service), wherein customers share a single instance of the software, with their data kept separate from others. This arrangement saves on underlying system resources and allows the vendor to push out updates and upgrades to many customers at once.\nEpicor's new application includes CRM (customer relationship management), production management, product management, financials, materials management and BI (business intelligence) capabilities such as role-based dashboards and a search engine.\nIt is also flexible enough to handle a range of manufacturing process styles, such as make-to-order, engineer-to-order and assembly, according to Epicor.\nThe software's various modules are built on top of a single relational database, providing tight integration, the company said.\nEpicor is guaranteeing 99.5 percent or higher system availability, with hosting in a tier-one datacenter certified under the SAS 70 Type II auditing guidelines. It has also built redundancies for backup and storage in a number of geographic locations.\nCustomers will be able to go live on the system within as soon as 20 business days, with the help of templates, pre-built sets of data and training, according to Epicor.\nEpicor Express uses a subset of functionality from the vendor's next-generation Epicor 9 release, according to Chad Meyer, director of product marketing. \"We took that footprint and took about 20-plus or so of the modules, bundled them together and created a template that overlays them, which simplifies the product for a job shop or small manufacturer,\" he said.\n\"With these small job shops, we understand there's a different workflow. Users could be doing quotes one minute, be on the floor next, and doing the books later in the day,\" Meyer added.\nSince Express is based on Epicor 9, it will be easy for customers to bring the application on-premises in the future if they choose, Meyer said.\nEpicor is also trying to protect customers' investment in the subscription-based model. For every year a customer remains on subscription pricing, Epicor will discount the price of moving to on-premises licenses by 20 percent, meaning that after five years it will cost nothing additional in license fees to make the switch.\nIn the future, Epicor plans to court larger customers with SaaS offerings, as well as different verticals, he said.\nPricing varies according to the number of users. A single user license would cost less than US$400 a month, while five users could come in under $1,000 per month, Meyer said. The software is initially available in the U.S., Canada and Mexico, with Europe the next likely target, he said.\nEpicor has five customers already live on the application, 15 in the process of implementation, and another 150 in the pipeline, Meyer said.\nOne initial user is Chirch Global Manufacturing, a McHenry, Illinois, manufacturer of close-tolerance progressive dies, metal stampings and assemblies. The company purchased another manufacturing firm in September 2008, and inherited an older version of Epicor's Vista ERP application, said CEO Anthony Chirchirillo.\nIt made more sense to make \"a quantum leap\" to a SaaS-based application, than attempt to bring the Vista software up to date, he said.\nChirch looked at other SaaS applications but was unsatisfied. \"The genesis of Epicor is as a manufacturing platform,\" while competing software offerings are merely adding on such capabilities, he said. \"That was a critical point for us.\"\nThe company is planning to stick with the SaaS model for the foreseeable future, he said. \"We're viewing it as the ability to stay focused on what we do well, and not trying to manage an IT environment.\"\nIn addition to smaller customers that are contemplating SaaS ERP applications, Epicor Express should also appeal to larger enterprises that are pursuing two-tier ERP strategies, tying smaller systems for new divisions or regions into a backbone application such as SAP, said analyst Ray Wang, partner with Altimeter Group.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: What modules are included in Epicor Manufacturing Express Edition?",

The vast majority of the world's countries, including all of the great powers, fought as part of two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. Many participants threw their economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind this total war, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the delivery of the only two nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in history, resulting in an estimated 70 to 85 million fatalities, mostly among civilians. Tens of millions died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of Axis defeat, Germany, Austria and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\n\n",

These features allow us to effectively collaborate on project timelines, share essential documents, and quickly locate past conversations. Slack also allows us to coordinate tasks and receive updates on external software, making it an ideal tool for any task-oriented team.\n\nThe software is already being used by teams from different industries to improve their internal communication and collaboration, and I believe it could help us significantly. I invite you to explore the features and discover how Slack can help streamline our workflow. Thank you for your time and consideration.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name]",

Sour Cream Apple Squares was 1 of 2 winners at the 26th Pillsbury Bake-Off in 1975. Recipe on Pillsbury.com by Luella Maki of Ely, Minnesota. In large bowl, combine flour, brown sugar and margarine; beat at low speed until crumbly. Stir in nuts. Press 2 3/4 cups crumb mixture in bottom of ungreased 13\u00d79-inch pan. Bake at 350\u00b0F. for 30 to 40 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 30 minutes. Cut into squares. Serve warm or cool. If desired, serve with whipped cream or ice cream. Store in refrigerator. I tried it both ways. Ice cream goes really well with this dessert. It would be even better with some homemade caramel sauce drizzled over it. Hi Lise! I really enjoyed looking at and reading about all of your 52 Pillsbury grand prize recipes in 52 weeks!

        "instruction": "An Alabama reader has a cheesy bean dip revamped for get-togethers and football parties.\nThe Story: An avid entertainer, Valenti has a playbook of tasty party recipes that she calls on for quick and easy crowd-pleasers. This bean dip, which uses several canned or bottled items and preshredded cheese, has been a long-time favorite. But since Valenti has a history of diabetes in her family and works to maintain a healthful weight, it\u2019s become more important for her to prepare good-for-you foods. \u201cI knew the fat content was high, so I tried serving the dip with packaged baked chips, which didn\u2019t go over well,\u201d she says. \u201cI experimented with low-fat products but couldn\u2019t quite get the flavors right. The dish needs a little excitement, but I want to keep the comforting appeal of the dip.\u201d Valenti turned to Cooking Light for help with her high-fat predicament.\nThe Dilemma: Served with corn chips, the dip included one cup each of shredded cheese and regular sour cream. A portion of this appetizer had more than its fair share of fat and calories. Each contained six grams of saturated fat, about a third of the recommended daily limit for a 2,000-calorie diet, according to the USDA Dietary Guidelines. The sodium was also excessive, with each serving packing 20 percent of the daily sodium allowance recommended by the American Heart Association.\nThe Solution: To reinvent this dip, our first step was to trade the heavy corn chips for healthier homemade flour tortilla chips. This cut almost nine grams of fat and 87 calories per serving and allowed us to keep regular cheese in the recipe. To further reduce fat, we switched from regular sour cream to light, trimming another gram of fat per serving. We also slightly reduced the amount of sour cream and cheese to keep calories and fat in check. Changing sliced olives to chopped allowed for better distribution of a slightly smaller amount and shaved 25 milligrams of sodium per serving. Using organic refried beans and salsa also helped manage sodium levels, dropping 141 milligrams per serving. A little fresh lime juice and ground cumin perked up the flavor of the beans without adding extra calories. Can you provide a healthier recipe for the cheesy bean dip mentioned in the text?",

        "instruction": "Can you summarize the work of the author concerning the development of mathematical models to understand the dynamics of neurons in the auditory pathway, and how these models are used to evaluate cochlear implant designs?: I develop mathematical models to describe the dynamics of neurons in the auditory pathway. The neuron pictured in the first column is in a region of the brain called the medial superior olive (or MSO). What\u2019s remarkable about these neurons, is that they are able to compare the timing of sounds arriving at our two ears with microsecond-scale temporal precision. This exquisite timing calculation allows us to sense the spatial locations from which sounds originate.\nI am currently working to understand how the structure of these cells affects their dynamics and function. Specifically, I am determining how the coupling between the axon and the cell affects the temporal precision of MSO neurons. To do this, I construct an idealized mathematical model of the neuron. I imagine that the cell can be lumped, roughly, into two regions: the axon (output) region and the remaining (input) regions. I then systematically explore the behavior of my mathematical neuron model as I change the connection between these regions.\nThis approach of formulating minimal, or idealized models, is a common strategy across my work. I use it to uncover essential properties of complex systems.\nI also develop mathematical models and methods to understand neural data recorded by experimental collaborators. One type of data that is relatively easy to obtain but difficult to understand is extracellular voltage. Extracellular voltages are recorded in the space between neurons. These signals represent a complicated mixture of the activity of many neurons.\nI recently worked with expert collaborators who recorded extracellular voltage signals in auditory regions of the brain. I developed a model that successfully reproduced the spatial-temporal patterns of extracellular voltages recorded by my collaborators, as shown in the middle column. Using this model, we gained new understanding of these complicated neural signals.\nUnfortunately, the auditory system does not always work flawlessly. For some individuals with profound hearing loss, surgically implanted devices called cochlear implants can restore a sense of hearing by electrically activating neurons in the inner ear. I have developed models to accurately simulate the responses of auditory neurons to cochlear implants, as shown here. I can then use this model to evaluate cochlear implant designs, by quantifying how effectively sound information is provided to users of these devices.\nThis project is especially gratifying because it represents an opportunity to use mathematics to improve the quality of life of individuals with hearing impairment.",

Photograph: Ian Walton/Getty Images.\nRussian long jumper Darya Klishina will compete at the Rio Olympics after her ban from the Games was struck down by sport's highest court on the eve of her event.\nRussian track and field suffered a final humiliation in Rio on Saturday when the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) suspended Klishina, the nation's only athlete to have so far survived a blanket doping ban, three days before she was due to compete.\nBut the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) told Reuters on Monday it had upheld Klishina's appeal against the ban.\n\"The parties were informed that the application was upheld and that the athlete remained eligible to compete in the Olympic Games in Rio,\" CAS said in a statement.\nKlishina had been given an exemption to compete in Rio as a neutral athlete after Russia's athletics squad was banned from the Games following revelations of state-backed doping in the country.\nAhead of the Games, the IAAF had ruled the 25-year-old, who is based in the United States, was not involved in the doping program and had been subject to sufficient drug tests outside of Russia.\nStriking down the ban, CAS said Klishina's permanent residence in the U.S. meant she still met the IAAF's competition criteria \"despite the additional information provided by Prof. McLaren.\n\"The athlete established that she was subject to fully compliant drug testing, in and out of competition, outside of Russia,\" CAS said in a statement.\nKlishina was reportedly seen on the warm-up track at Rio's Olympic Stadium on Sunday, prompting speculation she would still be able to compete.\nQualifying for the women's long jump begins on Tuesday.\nCan you summarize the Court of Arbitration for Sport's decision to uphold Darya Klishina's appeal against her ban from the Rio Olympics?",

Essentially, before you actually start doing anything, you should put together a good plan of what will be required of your work, including details relating to the research, as well as which sections you will need to include.\nIn fact, the research side of things is incredibly important too. As long as you do enough research, the writing process can be made relatively effortless.\nOnce you have written the work, it is important that you check over things to avoid making any mistakes. Essentially, the proofreading and editing stages of the writing process gives you a chance to read what you have written, and identify any spelling or grammatical errors that might have occurred.\nWhether you want to make this process is effortless as possible, or you are simply lacking in confidence in your ability to get the proofreading and editing done to a high standard, it is possible to hire a professional to check the work for you instead. In fact, there are many professional writing agencies that can be found using any major search engine, which will offer proofreading and editing services for any academic work that you have produced.\nIt has to be said, whilst the tips above can reduce the amount of effort that you have to put in, so as to make the writing process a great deal easier, they do not necessarily enable you to compose an academic paper without any effort. However, it is still possible to have a high quality piece of work produced without having to put any effort in at all.\nAs mentioned, it is possible to use professional writing agencies to proofread and edit the work that you have written stop however, many of these agencies will also offer a wide range of other services, including the possibility of having a bespoke these of work created.

Flow is often associated with peak performance, when people are fully engaged in activities like art, sports, gaming, and meditation.
