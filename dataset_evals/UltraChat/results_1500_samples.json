    "user_prompt": "How does the author propose to fix the problem of science alienation in our educational system? What changes does she suggest should be made to science education? Answer according to: Science education should be split into two tracks.\nSplit K-12 science education into two tracks, for majors and nonmajors.\nThose who want to specialize in science could take math and complex chemistry. Nonmajors would focus on science of the everyday\u2014things like kitchen chemistry and CSI-style crime investigations.\nSome years ago, when I was working as a newspaper science writer in California, I fell into a rather idle conversation with a physicist on the subject of science education. Idle for him, at least, because what he said\u2014the way he defined the American system of teaching K-12 students about science\u2014has stayed with me since.\nThis conversation has returned to me many times over the years. On the day my older son, who spent his childhood joyfully chasing insects and reading natural history books, came home from high school to announce that \u201cbiology is the most boring subject in the world.\u201d The time the student adviser at the University of Wisconsin journalism school, where I teach, told me that undergrads don\u2019t want to take science-writing classes because they already felt \u201cbeaten up by science.\u201d Even on days when I read science literacy statistics and am startled by the percentage of people who think that antibiotics kill viruses as well as bacteria or that the sun revolves around the Earth.\nIt\u2019s easy for me to join with the chorus of concern over whether we are keeping up as a science-literate country. But even so, science literacy is the wrong term for the worried point I\u2019m making here. I\u2019m concerned about science alienation. The way we teach K-12 science, with its emphasis on the intricacies of formula and mathematical structure necessary for the next generation of scientists and engineers, shuts too many people out. I don\u2019t mean just shut out of the priesthood here; there\u2019s no reason for everyone to become a scientist. But shut out of the comfort zone, of the ability to think of science as something useful in daily life.\nAnd it\u2019s the science-alienated who matter to me. Partly because as a science writer I find them the most interesting audience\u2014I love the idea of seducing someone convinced that science is boring or meaningless into reading a research-centered story. Partly because I worry that what The New Yorker\u2019s Michael Specter describes as a culture of science denialism is having a profound\u2014possibly dangerous\u2014effect on public policies. Think, for instance, of recent moves in Virginia, Texas, and North Carolina to deny that sea level rise is related to global climate change. And partly I just think that the filtered-out are cheated. They endure the mandatory classes, but they never really learn the main lesson\u2014the way that science helps us understand ourselves and the world around us.\nThe great psychologist and philosopher William James wrote more than 100 years ago that the science establishment would face consequences if it dismissed the importance of the lay public. In the year 1909, he said, it was easy to find people who no longer paid attention to the teachings of researchers. \u201cThey are indifferent to science,\u201d he explained, \u201cbecause science is so callously indifferent to their experiences.\u201d Today, this is very relevant to K-12 science education: Our system breeds that indifference.\nHow can we fix it? By requiring even more science education\u2014but changing it dramatically. All high school students should have to take four years of science, instead of the minimal two usually required for graduation. Along with that, we should also offer separate \u201cscience tracks\u201d\u2014something like the old tracks for vocational or college-bound students. Those who want to specialize in science could take math, physics, and complex chemistry (and the kind of genetically detailed biology that my son disliked). Nonmajors, by contrast, would focus on what I think of as science of the everyday\u2014things like kitchen chemistry, CSI-style crime investigation, the biology of health, and a class in the physics of sports that would include playing the games.\nMy tracking system could easily build on existing science electives. My son\u2019s school, for instance, teaches a forensic science unit which uses the classroom as an ever changing \u201ccrime scene,\u201d exploring everything from DNA analysis to blood typing. It\u2019s a way of putting science in context. More students would take such classes; more would be exposed to these ideas as they did the coursework needed to complete each track. Ideally, the tracks could be coordinated with the science classes offered for majors and nonmajors at the college level. Of course, occasionally a student might want to switch tracks\u2014and we should allow for that, too. It could go both ways: Would-be scientists might realize that the field isn\u2019t really for them and switch to the nonmajor track, while some students might be inspired by the CSI class to move into the more difficult sciences.\nWe need to stop trying to teach every child as either a future scientist or a future failed scientist. We don\u2019t want or need every student to be a scientist, but we do want each one to be a success. And success includes a solid understanding and appreciation of science, one that will remain useful to both themselves and society throughout their lives.\nAlso in Slate\u2019s special issue on science education: Fred Kaplan explains why another \u201cSputnik moment\u201d would be impossible; Philip Plait explains why he became the \u201cBad Astronomer\u201d; Paul Plotz describes how almost blowing up his parents\u2019 basement made him a scientist; Tom Kalil says that the Obama administration is using the Make movement to encourage science education; and Dana Goldstein explains why you should make your daughter play video games. Also, share your ideas for fixing science education in the Hive. This article arises from Future Tense, a joint partnership of Slate, the New America Foundation, and Arizona State University.",

Electronic address: andresrodriguez@conicet.gov.ar.\nThe purpose of this research was to identify differences between two contrasting rice cultivars in their response to suboptimal low temperatures stress. A transcriptomic analysis of the seedlings was performed and results were complemented with biochemical and physiological analyses. The microarray analysis showed downregulation of many genes related with PSII and particularly with the oxygen evolving complex in the sensitive cultivar IR50. Complementary studies indicated that the PSII performance, the degree of oxygen evolving complex coupling with the PSII core and net photosynthetic rate diminished in this cultivar in response to the stress. However, the tolerant cultivar Koshihikari was able to maintain its energy equilibrium by sustaining the photosynthetic capacity. The increase of oleic acid in Koshihikari could be related with membrane remodelling of the chloroplasts and hence contribute to tolerance. Overall, these results work as a ground for future analyses that look forward to characterize possible mechanisms to tolerate this stress. How did the tolerant rice cultivar Koshihikari maintain its photosynthetic capacity under suboptimal low temperatures stress, and what possible mechanisms could contribute to its tolerance?",

    "user_prompt": "LAS VEGAS, Nevada -- Another local casino property in default on its debt did not receive good news with its first-quarter earnings.\nHooters Hotel widened its net loss in the first quarter, with steep declines in hotel revenues driven by fewer overnight visitors and lower room rates.\nThe off-Strip property posted a net loss of $4 million in the first quarter ended March 31, a filing late Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission shows.\nThe loss nearly doubles the $2.2 million loss posted in the same quarter last year.\nNet revenues fell 19.2 percent, to $13.3 million from $16.5 million last year, driven partially by an 18.4 percent decrease in casino revenues.\nThe 696-room hotel, however, saw revenues drop 32.4 percent as average daily room rates were cut 35 percent to $52 per night. Occupancy fell from 87.9 percent to 82.8 percent for the quarter.\nBarbara Cappaert, a bond analyst with KDP Investment Advisors, said second-tier properties such as Hooters will \"recover later than the larger casinos.\"\nShe continued, \"For Hooters, this will mean highly promotional room rates for some time,\" due to lower rates by \"better capitalized Las Vegas Strip operators.\"\nCash flow, defined as earning before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, dropped by 50 percent to $1.67 million in the quarter.\nThe property went into default, something Cappaert predicted in early February, on two separate facilities totaling $144.5 million after the quarter ended. The letter of default was received on April 7 from Wells Fargo Foothill, the administrative agent on the loans.\nThe property's ownership had announced March 31 that it was not going to pay an interest payment due the next day.\nThe property had nearly $8 million in cash and the owners would continue to pay employees and vendors without interruption, the March 31 statement said. The property's owners are in discussions with some lenders about a possible forbearance agreement while the negotiations on a possible debt restructure continue, a May 7 federal filing said. What is the reason for the decline in revenue and increase in net loss for Hooters Hotel?",

    "user_prompt": "Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material\n\nQuestion/Instruction: How can camellias be grown in containers?\n\nGiven material: Camellias fill the late winter garden with colorful flowers.\nLandscaping with camellias (Camellia spp.) adds year-round color to your outdoor space. These broadleaf evergreen shrubs grow an average of 6 to 12 feet tall and are hardy in U.S. Department of Agriculture plant hardiness zones 7 through 9. According to the United States National Arboretum, the most common species of camellia include Japanese or common camellia (Camellia japonica), which blooms in late winter and early spring and sasanqua camellia (Camellia sasanqua), which blooms in fall. Camellias can be used as a landscape specimen, shrub border or privacy screen. Choosing the right planting spot is the key to successfully using these low-maintenance shrubs in your landscape design.\nCamellias grow best in well-drained soil with a pH of 6.0 to 6.5. Plant camellias near other acid-loving plants, such as \"Jean Marie De Montague\" rhododendron (Rhododendron x \"Jean Marie de Montague\" (H-3)), which is hardy in USDA zones 6 through 9. Another option is \"Happy Days\" azalea (Azalea indica \"Happy Days\"), hardy in USDA zones 9 to 11. Space other plants at least five feet away from other plants to allow enough space for mature plants to have good air circulation while also preventing the plant from having to compete too much for water while becoming established.\nPlant rows of camellias as a hedge or to form a natural, colorful privacy screen. Tall camellia cultivars that work as a hedge include \"Yuletide\" or \"Spring's Promise\" Ice Angels camellia. \"Yuletide\" is hardy in USDA zones 7 through 10 and grows 8 to 10 feet tall, with a similar spread. \"Spring\u2019s Promise\" grows in USDA zones 6 through 10, reaching heights and widths of 6 to 8 feet. American Camellia Society recommends planting camellias three feet apart when using them as hedges.\nCreate a profusion of color in your outdoor space. Camellias can be used as a backdrop for shorter shrubs and perennials that bloom after camellias have finished blooming because the plants' glossy, green foliage offers an attractive backdrop to the planting bed. Other options include planting other colorful perennials in a similar shade and with a similar bloom time as the camellia to create a mass of color in the garden. You can also plant camellias in planting beds, along with other shrubs and perennials with varying bloom times, to create a multiseason display.\nGrow camellias in containers to fill empty corners, add interest to small outdoor spaces or to place on either side of an entryway. Smaller cultivars include \"Fairy Blush,\" which grows 4 to 5 feet tall and features dark pink flower buds that unfurl to reveal delicate pink flowers. \"Marge Miler\" is smaller, growing only 1 foot tall. It blooms in fall with delicate pink flowers. Repot container-grown plants every two or three years. Avoid using garden soil in containers because it can be too heavy. American Camellia Society recommends a potting mix for camellias and fertilizing the plants during the growing season with a camellia-specific fertilizer or with a mixture of 1 part iron and 4 parts cottonseed meal.\nAnderson, Caryn. \"Landscaping With Camelias.\" Home Guides | SF Gate, http://homeguides.sfgate.com/landscaping-camelias-52433.html.

    "user_prompt": "Do not cast a wide net blindly. Instead, use targeted keyword outreach to speak directly to people interested in and looking for what you offer. Your best bet on growing your audience is to capture those voices on Twitter that are talking about you or your product/service.\nFor instance, Infantino, a baby product line, has inserted themselves into conversations that are directly related to their products. This conversation below includes a problem-solution tactic in which an outside user is not only speaking to Infantino as a brand, but is thereafter likely to follow the brand and potentially convert on the product mentioned.\nOne way to find these conversations is by utilizing TweetDeck. Once you log in, you will find the capability to search on Twitter in the upper left-hand corner.\nEnter your keywords into this area individually. For instance, if you are McDonald\u2019s, you might enter \u201cburger,\u201d \u201ccheeseburger,\u201d \u201chamburger,\u201d \u201cfries,\u201d \u201ckid-friendly restaurant,\u201d \u201cfast food,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m hungry,\u201d \u201clunch,\u201d \u201cbreakfast,\u201d and so on. Once you search through the conversations that are pulled in, you will be able to see which keywords work well for your brand and which ones might take more time than they are worth. Whenever appropriately possible, enter your brand into conversations with ease.\nWhen done correctly, your brand will see numbers lift through this effort. Immediately, you will see increases in your reach, tweet impressions, and profile visits through your outreach efforts. You will also see your number of followers increase. When providing a link in your tweets, you will then see website traffic increase. If this does not sound enticing, let\u2019s take an even deeper look into the positive outcomes of keyword outreach. Through reaching out to an interested user, your tweet is basically guaranteed to be viewed by that particular account. However, that tweet will also live on that person\u2019s page and timeline. Therefore, it will be viewed by their following and further expand your net to more like-minded users. If responding to users on an individual basis does not appeal to your brand, there are other strategies to practice.\nTweetchats are real-time hashtag conversations. Research what tweetchats are aligned with your brand and when they go live each week. Then, actively tweet within that chained conversation with the engaged users contributing to the tweetchat. This is a great way to place your brand as an authority in the space and on that particular subject. It also serves as great brand awareness to people active within your targeted subject of choice. From this activity, you should see profile visits, mentions, and following size increase. As you can see in the example below, Power Digital is highly active within tweetchats related to digital marketing.\nIncorporate strategies within your tweets themselves, such as encouraging retweets as your CTAs. Moreover, create a branded hashtag for your following to use in order to increase brand awareness and drive social traffic back to your Twitter profile. If you are able to host a giveaway, do so on your Twitter profile and have an entry point be to retweet the post. This will increase your reach and capture more followers.\nAccounts are rewarded for being social on Twitter. Just as you want your tweets to be retweeted, so you should retweet relevant tweets by non-competitors. This will increase your presence on the platform, your brand awareness to other accounts, and it will foster relationships on the platform that can become mutually beneficial for everyone involved.\nOutside of the platform, have your staff insert a \u201cFollow on Twitter\u201d link in their email signature. All employees should be a brand advocate and continually spread interest in your brand. Each email can become a touch point for growing your following.\nOverall, the best way to grow your Twitter following is by being highly active on the platform. Whether your brand decides to reach out to individuals, join a tweetchat party, or simply incorporate content strategies within posts, remaining active is key. How can retweeting relevant tweets by non-competitors help to increase a brand's presence on Twitter?",

    "user_prompt": "What is the benefit of using a white-label business video hosting provider like DaCast for your event?: The context\u2013your company is planning a large event with expert speakers, fascinating workshops, and top-tier opportunities for networking. As it stands, it already sounds like an excellent plan for a successful event. Yet, as the old adage goes\u2013there\u2019s always room for improvement! Nowadays, streaming live events is a popular way to do just that.\nFor example, did you know you could use a video hosting platform to record and distribute your content? That\u2019s just one of the various marketing methods your company can develop and execute in order to promote your event. There\u2019s a whole world of streaming solutions out there just ready and waiting.\nNow, let\u2019s take a look a key features for streaming live events below.\nThe first important feature for successfully streaming live events is a top-tier CDN. The term CDN stands for Content Distribution Network. A global network of computer servers comprises a CDN.\nThese servers rapidly duplicate video content and share it via the network. This makes video much faster for users. It also provides benefits like security, redundancy, and better loading speeds.\nThere are many CDNs on the market today. In the past, we\u2019ve written CDN comparisons to review these services. But here\u2019s the short version: Akamai is the biggest, fastest, and best CDN on the market today. DaCast uses Akamai for every live stream and video on-demand. This way, we give each user affordable access to premium top-tier content delivery.\nThe second feature that\u2019s great to have for streaming live events is a live countdown. Basically, this feature allows you to embed a video player on your websites before your event takes place. The player will show a countdown to your event.\nThis is a simple feature, but it can boost excitement for your events. All Dacast plans include this features. It\u2019s easy to add a live countdown to your events.\nThe third feature that\u2019s essential for successful live events is using a white-label OVP. White label refers to a platform that doesn\u2019t include any branding except your own. You can insert your own logos and customize the video player to match your colors and branding. With a professional-grade video platform like DaCast, this is easy to do.\nThe fourth feature on our list is live event recording. Recording a live stream should be easy. Sure, you can do it manually on-location. But cloud recording is easy, fast, and makes it simple to get a live streamed event online as a video on-demand within minutes.\nDaCast includes a live streaming recording feature with all pricing plans. Turning on this feature only takes a few clicks, and it records all your live streams in the highest available quality.\nThis information can be used live, while your stream is in progress, to assess success. You can also utilize it afterward to help refine your strategy and improve future streaming live events.\nConsumer-grade video platforms like YouTube can\u2019t offer many of these features. These platforms are designed to make money off you\u2014not to help you monetize your streaming live events.\nInstead, you need a professional-grade Online Video Platform like DaCast. A professional OVP offers a wide range of features that simply aren\u2019t available with free platforms. Plus, these platforms include customer support and professional services to help you build a professional platform and keep it running smoothly.\nDaCast includes all the above features. Our service also includes monetization, API access, and much more. All this is delivered at an affordable price that\u2019s competitive with every other platform on the market.\nAt first glance, content marketing seems pretty simple \u2013 create content that\u2019s valuable to your customers. However, it\u2019s a bit more complex than that. Content marketing, especially for events, is all about strategy. Events only last for a limited period of time, so you\u2019ll need to plan ahead, paying special attention to timing.\nFor example, in terms of social media, you may use Facebook primarily for pre-event marketing. Then, you can use Twitter and Instagram to live tweet and share photos during the event itself. Finally, you can move on to a video-based strategy for promoting the event after the fact.\nOther social media platforms can be used to help engage an audience before, during, and after an event. Instagram and Facebook are incredibly popular, and along with Twitter, form the trifecta that every organization should at least consider using.\nUse a hashtag for your events (for example, #DaCast2016).\nConsider using images and videos. Visual content often does better on social media than text alone.\nOrganize some sort of contest or giveaway on social media.\nRelease teasers and snippets to generate more buzz.\nConsider using live polls and surveys to engage with the audience even more.\nIf recording your event is not part of your marketing plan, you should get on it! In 2019, if there is no video, it didn\u2019t happen. Video is a crucial part of preparing for content marketing after an event takes place, and even while the event is happening.\nVideo recordings allow for many marketing opportunities after the fact. These range from the simple (selling the recording to anyone who is interested) to the complex (re-broadcasting the recordings periodically to further capitalize on the time and money that went into holding the event).\nTo ease this process, look into using a white-label business video hosting provider such as DaCast to simplify your video embedding onto your website to monetize your stream.\nSponsors and partner organizations can serve a few valuable functions. For starters, they can be a source of valuable back-links to your event website. Secondly, they can serve as hosts for guest posts, which increase your SEO rank and also expose your event to new audiences. Finally, sponsors and partners can provide financial support to help make other marketing efforts possible.\nIf you\u2019re ready to try live streaming events today, we offer a 30-day free trial (no credit card required)! Click the button below to start streaming live today!\nStill have questions about live streaming for events, DaCast as a streaming provider, or online video in general?

    "user_prompt": "Can you summarize the Toy Story franchise and the theme of its previous three films? Answer according to: A Toy Story 4 clip was released on Sunday night during the Super Bowl in the US. The 30-seconds long clip does not reveal anything about the story, it is still welcome as a glimpse into those beloved characters and a fun, irreverent tone.\nWoody (Tom Hanks) and Bo Peep (Annie Potts), who is making a return to the franchise, approach an amusement park. Woody finds the place great. Bo Peep want to know about Buzz who was to meet them there. Woody replies he must be held up somewhere.\nAnd we get to see Buzz being caught up. He is in a carnival game and is the top prize. Other toys are not happy about it and resent the situation. Buzz gets kicked on the head, until he traps the toy\u2019s feet with his glass helmet.\nToy Story franchise, for the uninitiated, is set up in a world where toys can talk while humans are unaware about it. These sentient toys have distinctive personalities keeping up with their theme (Woody, is a swashbuckling Western hero and Buzz, a space-trotting cop). These stories treat toys as humans and the first three films dealt with heavy (for kids\u2019 films) themes of letting go of childhood, nostalgia and so on.\nToy Story 4\u2019s synopsis reads, \u201cWoody (voice of Tom Hanks) has always been confident about his place in the world, and that his priority is taking care of his kid, whether that\u2019s Andy or Bonnie. So when Bonnie\u2019s beloved new craft-project-turned-toy, Forky (voice of Tony Hale), declares himself as \u201ctrash\u201d and not a toy, Woody takes it upon himself to show Forky why he should embrace being a toy. But when Bonnie takes the whole gang on her family\u2019s road trip excursion, Woody ends up on an unexpected detour that includes a reunion with his long-lost friend Bo Peep (voice of Annie Potts).\nToy Story 4 is slated to be released on June 21.",

    "user_prompt": "Can you summarize the recent achievement of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and its impact on India's science and technology? Generate according to: The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) today launched 104 satellites in a single shot through PSLV-C37 at Sriharikota station in Andhra Pradesh at 9.28 AM. Out of 104 satellites, 96 satellites are from United States of America (USA). The rocket in full swing begins to place the satellites one after the other into the orbit from 9:45 Am onwards. This stupendous feat of the ISRO scripted a remarkable chapter in the history of India and in specifically Indian Science and Technology. This act of ISRO placed India in the list of developed countries in the category of space technology. This even proved the supremacy of the India in Space. When all the Indian students, mostly IIT students, are eagerly running out to western countries thinking that research opportunities are more outside than in India, the complete world is now marching towards India to look at India\u2019s scientific development. The most significant thing is, more than 70% of the ISRO scientists are not from IIT. For one batch of IIT students to come out government spends close to 100 crores and these IIT students, rather than making IIT as production house of innovations are making IIT as INDIAN INSITITUTE OF TRAVELERS. So my dear students, work hard and aim high, even if you are not from IIT\u2019s you can become a scientist. If you are not from IIT, be proud, as one day you will make an IITan in NASA feel proud that he is proud of being Indian seeing your achievement in India. I wholeheartedly Thank ISRO for motivating students (other than IITans) to aim bigger and achieve biggest, even in staying in India and even by being an Indian.JAI HIND.",

    "user_prompt": "Could you summarize the author's experience of learning to ride her own bike? Answer according to: As many of you know 2017 was my first summer riding my own bike. I was always content to ride behind Andy and chat along, take photos and on occasion I even worked, thank god for smart phones where our offices can be where ever we choose them to be. I often get asked why I decided to get my own bike so here it is \u2013 I just needed to. A couple of years ago at the end of the season we were out riding and I wanted to go back to look at something so Andy found a parking lot to turn around and for those that ride you know that going slow is when most accidents happen. Well we went down, not hard but hard enough to scare us, once we got our bearings we were able to pick the bike up and ride it home. I rode a bit afterwards and was very nervous and before we knew it it was time to put the bike away for the winter. Well the next spring came I was still having issues with my nerves. A few times Andy could tell that he needed to stop. Without me saying a word he knew I was having an anxiety attack. I was fine when we were flat-out riding but going slow and turning was hard on me and therefore hard on Andy. That summer I still enjoyed the bike but not like before. Once agin, before we knew it it was time to put the bike away for another winter. Enter 2017. When we would drive in the car I had issues. Andy knew it was easier on my if I drove as he started riding in the passenger\u2019s seat more. The spring rolled around and it was time to get out riding I was better but I was still anxious. Canada Day weekend came around and some family invited us to come ride with them up on the Bruce. Well after seeing Andy\u2019s cousin Mary handling her bike and seeing the pure joy it bought her I knew what I was going to do that coming week! For my birthday I went and wrote my M1 \u2013 and failed \ud83d\ude41 I went in not knowing that I had to write my whole G1. I thought because I was already a licensed driver (of over 20 years) that I just would have to write the motorcycle part \u2013 I was wrong. I\u2019m happy to say that I got all the questions regarding the motorcycle and road signs right. The only questions I got wrong were the rules around driving with a G1 & G2. Anyway, I went back the next day and secured my M1 and called around to book my bike course. The day after that I bought my very first bike! A Suzuki Marauder 250! While we waited for me to take my M2 course, the weekend of July 21st, Andy would ride my bike down to an empty parking lot and I\u2019d drive the car so I could learn some basics. I really didn\u2019t want to show up at the course and not even know what it felt like to ride my own bike. The one thing that Andy was insistent on was not teaching me to much. He didn\u2019t want to teach me any bad habits that he\u2019d picked up over his years of riding and I was ok with that answer. One thing that I did learn was riding a bike was a lot harder and tiring than I ever thought. By the end of the weekend I was having a blast, turning to the right and left, changing gears, learning emergency stopping. I\u2019m happy to say that at the end of the weekend I passed the ministry test and was on to my M2. What I looked like after 2 hours. I think the bruises on my arms were from my mirrors. It\u2019s the only thing that I could figure out. We continued to ride a lot over the rest of the summer and fall. At the end of September I did my first solo trip to my Dad\u2019s (roughly 3.5 hours away) and when I came back I bought my second bike. I still have a lot of learning to do but am very comfortable riding now and since I\u2019ve started riding my own bike I haven\u2019t had any more anxiety issues when riding. I\u2019m not saying this is the answer for everybody but it was the answer for me.",

    "user_prompt": "How can solar panel manufacturers maintain a competitive edge and retain customers in the face of increasing Chinese competition and the eventual removal of tariffs on solar panels?\nGenerate according to: My, my, I\u2019m getting all sorts of e-blasts and seeing ads from various solar companies telling me that they have tariff-free solar panels! Yay! \u2026Or not.\nYes, you have a temporary advantage over those tier one brands that do or will have tariffs imposed, but you\u2019re not the only tariff-free brand on the block, and \u2013wait! Looky-looky over there! Many more bankable solar panel brands, including the Chinese, are moving into new facilities outside of the dreaded tariff zone. In perhaps a year or less, so much for your tariff-free pricing advantage.\nNo, my solar PV panel manufacturing friends, marketing on price\u2014essentially \u201ctariff-free\u201d\u2014is still a low profit margin strategy. You\u2019ve entered the solar race to the bottom rather than marketing like you\u2019re the most reliable, best-in-class, bankable solar panel that solar installers want to hug, or at least buy consistently.\nSo let\u2019s agree that you have a short window until most of the Chinese manufacturers are tariff-free again and the supply chain returns to normal levels. With that in mind, what are you going to do now to make sure that your new customers stay with you after \u201ctariff-free\u201d isn\u2019t an advantage?\n1) Treat customers, big and small, equally.\nCongrats on selling a few megawatts to the big guys, but a) I\u2019ll bet they drove your price down, and b) next month that same developer is going to find another panel manufacturer that\u2019s even lower.\nThe fact is that there\u2019s still a lot of competition out there, so you should continue to treat every solar customer, big and small, like royalty. Give everyone the same terms, deliver when you say you will, and if you\u2019re going to pick and choose who gets your currently sparse inventory, very publicly state that due to blah, blah, blah, you need a minimum purchase of X Watts. For those who meet that minimum order, deliver as promised and on time, even if another big order comes in. This transparency makes you a trusted partner, not a one-time solar panel cookie jar that sells panels to selected good customers when you feel like it.\n2) Start building solar communities.\n3) Do a PR solid for the entire solar industry.\nIf you want to really seal a long-term brand relationship with customers, Wall St, and non-customers, then do a random act of solar kindness that not only boosts your company, but also boosts the solar industry. And don\u2019t do what\u2019s already been done a million times like an ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. I mean do that, sure, but also do something equally original that brings attention to the solar causes of clean energy and climate change.\nAll of what I\u2019m saying has a cost, I know. Extra levels of customer service, marketing initiatives, and solar advocacy all cost money, but think of it as a brand loyalty investment that will especially pay off when all those tariff brands are back at the same price and telling your new customers that they\u2019re tariff-free just like you. Then what? Will they stay or go?\nIf you\u2019ve done any or all of the above and truly given your new customers a reason to stay at a competitive price, then perhaps they\u2019ll not only become brand loyal, but also proudly talk about your solar brand to their customers and other installers, and wouldn\u2019t that be swell. \u2026 UnThink Solar.\nTor Valenza a.k.a. \u201cSolar Fred\u201d is a solar marketing and communications consultant at UnThink Solar and the author of Solar Fred\u2019s Guide to Solar Guerrilla Marketing.

    "user_prompt": "Given the text: \"The Tao does nothing, and yet nothing is left undone\" These famous words of Lao-tzu obviously cannot be taken in their literal sense, for the principle of \"nonaction\" (wu-wei) is not to be considered inertia, laziness, laissez-faire, or mere passivity. Among the several meanings of wei are to be, to do, to make, to practice, to act out; and also it means false, simulated, counterfeit. But in the context of Taoist writings it quite clearly means forcing, meddling, and artifice-in other words, trying to act against the grain of li. Thus wu-wei as \"not forcing\" is what we mean by going with the grain, rolling with the punch, swimming with the current, trimming sails to the wind, taking the tide at its flood, and stooping to conquer. It is perhaps best exemplified in the Japanese arts of Judo and Aikido where an opponent is defeated by the force of his own attack, and the latter art reaches such heights of skill that I have seen an attacker thrown to the floor without even being touched.\nThe principle is illustrated by the parable of the pine and the willow in heavy snow. The pine branch, being rigid, cracks under the weight; but the willow branch yields to the weight, and the snow drops off. Note, however, that the willow is not limp but springy. Wu-wei is thus the lifestyle of one who follows the Tao, and must be understood primarily as a form of intelligence \u0096 that is, of knowing the principles, structures, and trends of human and natural affairs so well that one uses the least amount of energy in dealing with them. But this intelligence is, as we have seen, not simply intellectual; it is also the \"unconscious\" intelligence of the whole organism and, in particular, the innate wisdom of the nervous system. Wu-wei is a combination of this wisdom with taking the line of least resistance in all one\u0092s actions. It is not the mere avoidance of effort. In judo, for example, one uses muscle \u0096 but only at the right moment, when the opponent is off balance or has overextended himself. But even this effort has a peculiarly unforced quality which is called ch\u0092i, roughly equivalent to the Sanskrit prana \u0096 an energy associated with breath.\nThis may be illustrated with the Aikido exercise of the unbendable arm. The right arm is extended to the front and the opponent is invited to bend it. If the arm is held rigidly, a strong opponent will certainly bend it. If, on the other hand, it is held out easily, with the eyes fixed on a distant point, and with the feeling that it is a rubber hose through which water is flowing towards that point, it will be extremely difficult to bend. Without straining, one simply assumes that the arm will stay straight, come what may, because of the flow of ch\u0092i. During the test, breathe out slowly, as if from the belly, and think of the breath as moving through the arm. This is perhaps a form of what we call, or rather miscall, self-hypnosis, which has nothing to do with sleep. I have found that something of the same kind can be used in opening a stiff cap on a jar, and I knew an old Zen master, frail in appearance, who, seemingly be leaning against them, moved heavy rocks which defeated strong young men.\"\nHow does the principle of wu-wei align with the Taoist belief system, and how can it be understood as a form of intelligence and wisdom that relates to the nervous system and our actions in the world?",

    "user_prompt": "Can you give me some background information about the making of 'Everything I Do' by Bryan Adams? Generate according to: Bryan Adams still holds the record for the most consecutive weeks at number one in the UK with this power ballad. You couldn't escape the theme from Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves in 1991, and it remains one of the greatest love songs of all time. Who wrote 'Everything I Do'? Bryan Adams wrote the song with composer Michael Kamen, who wrote the score for Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, and producer Robert 'Mutt' Lange. Lange also produced the record. The song was based orchestral music from the film by Kamen, and was written in London at the studio Adams was working at in 1990. Adams and Lange wrote it in 45 minutes, and recorded it the following March. How was it used in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves? This song is featured in the Kevin Costner movie Robin Hood: Prince Of Thieves, where it plays over the credits. Adams used a line in the movie, \"I do it for you...\" as the basis for the song. Adams later said that the song didn't originally meet Hollywood approval, as the film company wanted the song to have instrumentation similar to the films' era, such as lutes and mandolins. Thankfully, the film company relented, but buried the song in the credits rather than in the film itself. Composer Michael Kamen originally wanted the song to be from the perspective of Maid Marian rather than Robin Hood. However, this early version was deemed too bland, and the likes of Kate Bush, Annie Lennox and Lisa Stansfield all turned it down. Alongside Bryan Adams, Chicago frontman Peter Cetera was approached to write a song for the film, having previously recorded 'Glory of Love' from The Karate Kid II. \u201cIn all honesty, Cetera\u2019s was too pretty,\u201d said Michael Kamen. Adams won the battle thanks to his rough voice, and moving lyrics about Marian and Robin\u2019s romance. The song was a massive chart success around the world, reaching number one in at least 16 countries. In the UK, it spent 16 consecutive weeks at number one, the longest run in British chart history. It sold over 15 million copies worldwide, making it Adams' most successful song, and one of the best-selling singles of all time. It also won a Grammy, but lost out at the Oscars to the title song from Beauty and the Beast.",

Answer according to: Singapore tourist guides and travel agents said their revenue has dropped by 80 per cent across all tiers of the market compared to six months ago.\nSINGAPORE: Strong Singapore dollar and weak Indian rupee as well as a new tax on flat-screen television sets have reduced the Indian tourist visitors to the city state, it was reported here today.\n\"Singapore's currency is very strong and the rupee is very weak. We are becoming less competitive for the Indian market,\" The Straits Times quoted director at Luxury Tours and Travel, Michael Lee, as saying.\nThe Indian market now makes up 28 per cent of the agency's sales, down from 38 per cent, said Lee, adding that the tourists from the country were now going to Europe or elsewhere, travelling domestically or to cheaper shorter distances such as Thailand.\nThe tourist flow to Singapore was also affected by a 36 per cent duty on flat-screen TV set imposed by the Indian government in August. The move was part of Indian government's efforts to stem the outflow of cash.\nDuty-free TV screens worth up to 35,000 rupees each were part of the Indian tourist baggage of popular electronics goods brought home from overseas shopping.\nTourist guide Shanti Devi Krishnasamy said her monthly one to three-day tours of 10 to 15 Indian groups was now down to two to three groups.\nThe Indian tourists would save enough to shop for the flat-screen TV and make their Singapore trip worth-while.\n\"That's gone too,\" Krishnasamy, 46, who has been a guide for six years, told the Singapore daily.\nDennis Law, director at Star Holiday Mart, said his travel agency's Indian business has dropped by 40 per cent over the past six months.\nIndia was Singapore's fifth largest tourist market with 6,70,000 visitors between January and September this year, according to data from the Singapore Tourism Board.\nHowever, the travel agencies have reported a 20 per cent increase in bookings for Singapore tourists visiting India from next month and in December.\n\"Local travellers think it's a good time to go to India. One Singapore dollar gets much more rupee,\" Eileen Oh, head of marketing and communications at ASA Holidays, told The Straits Times.\nThe Indian rupee was 49.7 to Singapore dollar on October 16, up from 44.15 in April.",

    "user_prompt": "Given the text: The Three Hundred Tang Poems (simplified Chinese: \u5510\u8bd7\u4e09\u767e\u9996; traditional Chinese: \u5510\u8a69\u4e09\u767e\u9996; pinyin: T\u00e1ngsh\u012b s\u0101nb\u01cei sh\u01d2u) is an anthology of poems from the Chinese Tang Dynasty (618 - 907) first compiled around 1763 by Sun Zhu (1722-1778), the Qing Dynasty scholar, also known as Hengtang Tuishi (\u8861\u5858\u9000\u58eb \"Retired Master of Hengtang\"). Various later editions also exist. All editions contain over 300 poems: in this case, three hundred means not exactly 300 but refers to an estimative quantification; the ten, twenty, or more extra poems represent a sort of a good luck bonus, analogous to the \"baker's dozen\" in the West. Even more, the number 300 (or more exactly 305) was a classic number for a poetry collection due to the influence of the Classic of Poetry (Shijing \u8a69\u7d93), which was generally known as The Three Hundred Poems.\nDissatisfied with the anthology Poems by a Thousand Masters (Qianjiashi \u5343\u5bb6\u8a69) compiled by Liu Kezhuang in the late Southern Song, and influenced by Ming Dynasty poetry anthologies, Sun selected the poems based on their popularity and educational value. The collection has been popular ever since and can be found in many Chinese households. For centuries, elementary students memorized the poems and used them to learn to read and write. It contains poems by Du Fu, Li Bai, Wang Wei, Li Shangyin, Meng Haoran, Han Yu, Du Mu, Bai Juyi, Liu Changqing, Cen Shen, Wang Changling, Wei Yingwu, and more. Li He is one notable Tang poet absent from the compilation.\nOut of 317 poems in one edition, 90 were in the gushi form and 227 were in the l\u00fcshi or the jueju forms.\nThe poets of the Tang shi include a number of authors ranging from the well-known and famous to obscure or anonymous poets, and even include at least one emperor. The poet with the most pieces included in this collection is Du Fu, with thirty-nine. Li Bo is a close runner-up, with thirty-four. Wang Wei has twenty-nine poems included in the anthology and Li Shangyin has twenty-four. Meng Haoran has fifteen, Wei Yingwu twelve, Liu Changqing eleven, and Du Mu ten. After that, each of the other poets' included pieces number in the single digits; however, some of these poets are quite important, such as Liu Zongyuan or Bai Juyi. Some important poets, such as Li He, are not represented at all.\nThe first complete translation of the Three Hundred Tang Poems into English was published as The Jade Mountain, translated by Witter Bynner and Jiang Kanghu. From 1929 through 1972 it went through ten editions. It has also been translated by Peter Harris in 2009.\nThis page was last modified on 9 August 2015, at 12:08.\nHow were the poems selected for inclusion in the anthology, and what was their educational significance?",

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.\nThis electronic payment services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +2.6%.\nRevenues are expected to be $1 billion, up 7% from the year-ago quarter.\nHow Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Total System?\nFor Total System, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.44%.\nSo, this combination indicates that Total System will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.\nFor the last reported quarter, it was expected that Total System would post earnings of $1.06 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.08, delivering a surprise of +1.89%.\nTotal System appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

    "user_prompt": "Can you summarize the findings of the study on sleep disorders among multiple sclerosis patients? Answer according to: \u201cA large percentage of MS subjects in our study are sleep deprived and screened positive for one or more sleep disorders,\u201d said Steven Brass, associate clinical professor and director of the Neurology Sleep Clinical Program and co-medical director of the UC Davis Sleep Medicine Laboratory.\nFatigue is the hallmark of multiple sclerosis, an inflammatory disease affecting the white matter and spinal cord of sufferers. MS symptoms include loss of vision, vertigo, weakness and numbness. Patients also may experience psychiatric symptoms. Disease onset generally is between the ages of 20 and 50 years. The cause of MS is not known, although it is believed to be an autoimmune condition.\nSleep disorders are known to occur more frequently among patients with MS. To gauge the extent of sleep disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea and insomnia, Brass and his colleagues surveyed members of the Northern California Chapter of the National MS Society. Subjects were recruited in 2011.\nMore than 11,000 surveys were mailed to prospective participants. Of those, 2,375 met criteria and were included in the study. Consistent with the reported epidemiology of multiple sclerosis, the majority (81 percent) were female and Caucasian (88 percent). The mean age of the participants was 54.\nParticipants were asked to complete a 10-page survey, which included a detailed sleep history and questions assessing obstructive sleep apnea, daytime sleepiness, insomnia and restless legs syndrome.\nMost of the participants - nearly 52 percent - said it took them more than one half hour to fall asleep at night, and nearly 11 percent reported taking a medication to fall asleep. Close to 38 percent of participants screened positive for obstructive sleep apnea. Nearly 32 percent had moderate to severe insomnia and nearly 37 percent had restless legs syndrome.\nHowever, most of the participants had not been diagnosed with a sleep disorder by a physician. While nearly 38 percent reported having obstructive sleep apnoea, only a little more than 4 percent reported being diagnosed by a physician with the condition. Similar statistics were seen for other sleep disorders.\n\u201cThis study shows that sleep disorder frequency, sleep patterns and complaints of excessive daytime sleepiness suggest that sleep problems may be a hidden epidemic in the MS population, separate from MS fatigue,\u201d Brass said.\nOther study authors include Chin-Shang Li of UC Davis and Sanford Auerbach of Boston University.",

    "user_prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What are some of the benefits that countries like Scotland and the UK could reap from investing in wave energy?\n\nPassage: It\u2019s not difficult to imagine what wind energy looks like \u2014 by this point we have all seen the towering turbines dotting the landscape. The same goes for solar power and the panels that are spreading across rooftops worldwide. But there is another form of renewable energy, available in huge quantities, that doesn\u2019t really call to mind anything at all: What does wave power technology look like?\nWind and solar power have taken off in the past decade or two, as costs have come down rapidly and threats from climate change have made clear the need to transition away from fossil fuels. Meanwhile, numerous studies have concluded that wave power \u2014 and to a lesser extent, tidal power \u2014 could contribute massive amounts to the overall energy picture. But while the industry has made halting progress, experts agree that it remains decades behind other forms of renewables, with large amounts of money and research required for it to even begin to catch up.\nNo commercial-scale wave power operations now exist, although a small-scale installation did operate off the coast of Portugal in 2008 and 2009. In February, U.S. corporate giant Lockheed Martin announced a joint venture to create the world\u2019s biggest wave energy project, a 62.5-megawatt installation slated for the coast of Australia that would produce enough power for 10,000 homes. Scotland, surrounded by the rough waters of the Atlantic and the North Sea, has become a hotbed of wave-energy research and development, with the government last year approving a 40-megawatt wave energy installation in the Shetland Islands.\nBut a central challenge has proven to be the complexity of harnessing wave power, which has led to a host of designs, including writhing snake-like attenuators, bobbing buoys, even devices mounted discreetly on the ocean floor that work by exploiting differences in pressure as a wave passes by. Some devices generate the electricity on the spot and transmit it via undersea cables to shore, while others pass the mechanical energy of the wave along to land before turning it into electrical energy. Which of these drastically divergent concepts might emerge as a winner is far from clear.\n\u201cWe may not have even invented the best device yet,\u201d said Robert Thresher, a research fellow at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.\nFrom a technical point of view, operating in the ocean is far more difficult than on land; building offshore wind installations, for example, tends to be significantly more expensive than constructing wind farms onshore. Saltwater is a hostile environment for devices, and the waves themselves offer a challenge for energy harvesting as they not only roll past a device but also bob up and down or converge from all sides in confused seas. This provides enticing opportunities for energy capture, but a challenge for optimum design.\nAs with any energy source, the fundamental roadblock toward more widespread deployment is cost. So far, the wave energy field is filled with small companies picking off small amounts of government funding where they can. It will likely require the participation of some large companies, such as GE or Siemens (both major manufacturers of wind turbines) before wave power really gets rolling, according to numerous experts. Those companies may be waiting for the technology to sort itself out before investing, a common dilemma in any nascent field.\nIn spite of the challenges inherent to the medium, the industry is progressing, albeit slowly. There are a few small wave farms and pilot projects in the water, including Pelamis Wave Power\u2019s first-ever wave farm off the coast of Northern Portugal. That company has a few megawatt-scale wave farms planned, while others, like Ocean Power Technologies, continue to deploy test devices to improve buoy-based technology.\nLockheed Martin\u2019s Australia project, which will use a buoy technology that generates electricity from the rising and falling of waves.\nAnother company, M3 Wave, plans to install a new device just off the Oregon coast this summer. M3 will be using a pressure-based device, sitting out of sight on the ocean floor. As a wave passes over it, air inside the device is pushed by pressure changes from one chamber to another, spinning a turbine to generate electricity.\nSo far, projects producing only a handful of megawatts have actually made it into the water, but experts say the industry needn\u2019t settle on one device before substantial progress occurs.\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if what we eventually find is there will be a device that we use in deeper water, and a device that we use nearer the shore,\u201d said Belinda Batten, a professor at Oregon State University and the director of the Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy Center.\nThe process to refine those technologies is ongoing. The European Marine Energy Centre in Scotland\u2019s Orkney Islands allows companies to connect their devices to existing infrastructure and cabling to test their electricity-generating capabilities and identify problems. Batten said her center based at Oregon State is in the permitting and approval process for a counterpart testing center that will enable companies to connect to the existing electricity grid for testing purposes.\nAlaska will likely have a monopoly on the U.S.\u2019s first generation of wave projects, while in Europe the United Kingdom \u2014 Scotland in particular \u2014 is focusing heavily on wave energy development. The U.K. government says the country could potentially get as much as 75 percent of its energy needs from the waves and tides combined; the U.S. Department of Energy, meanwhile, estimates that wave power in the U.S. could generate as much 1,170 terawatt-hours per year, which is equivalent to more than one quarter of all U.S. electricity consumption.\nenergy is expensive because of reliance on costly imported fuels like diesel. \u201cThere has been an interest in some of the island communities,\u201d Thresher said.\nWith the industry starting to develop larger projects and continuing to test myriad devices in search of the best designs, does that mean wave power could finally be on its way, just as wind was 25 years ago?\nJason Busch, executive director of the Oregon Wave Energy Trust \u2014 a non-profit group dedicated to helping advance the industry \u2014 said that there are too many variables, such as the price of natural gas or eventual passage of a carbon tax, to apply the experience of wind or solar power to a different technology and time period.",

    "user_prompt": "Here is a piece of text: Why Is Starbucks So Expensive in China?\nImagine walking into Starbucks and discovering that your grande latte cost $27. You'd probably think that the world's coffee supply had suddenly vanished. Or that you'd traveled by time machine many decades into the future.\nThese inflated prices gives you a pretty good idea of the relative cost (adjusted to per capita income) of what a Chinese person pays for the drink. China's per capita income, at about $7,200, is around five and a half times less than the American figure. Yet at a Starbucks in Beijing, a grande latte goes for about $4.80\u2014or a dollar more than what it costs in the United States. A simple beverage of espresso and steamed milk is pretty damned expensive in China.\nConsidering this, it's a small miracle that Starbucks is still in business there at all. But in fact, the Seattle-based caffeine empire's China operations are thriving. Last December, Bloomberg reported that Starbucks plans to double its China workforce by 2015, adding hundreds of new stores in cities across the country in the process. The company even expects China to become its second largest market\u2014behind just the United States\u2014by this time.\nIn fairness, per capita income is a crude way to measure the buying power of Starbucks' actual customer base: The majority of its stores are located in China's large, coastal cities, where most people earn a lot more than the nationwide per capita average. Nevertheless, it's striking that in a developing country, one lacking an indigenous coffee-drinking culture, so many people are willing to pay a premium for Starbucks products. Logically, wouldn't it make sense for Starbucks to drop its prices a little in order to attract even more customers?\nWhat's expensive are the logistics. The coffee beans Starbucks brews in its Beijing stores, as well as other materials like cups and mugs, don't cost any more to import in China than in the United States. The problem is getting these materials from point A to point B. \"Transporting coffee beans from, say, Colombia to the port of Tianjin is about the same as transporting them from Colombia to the port of Los Angeles,\" says David Wolf, a public relations professional and expert in Chinese business. \"It's getting them from the port in Tianjin to the store in Beijing that's expensive.\" China has invested billions of dollars over the years to improve its port and transportation infrastructure, but the combination of taxes, fees, and middle-men add to logistics costs\u2014which are then passed on to customers in the form of marked-up frappuccinos and lattes.\nSo if Starbucks is so expensive in China, why do so many people go there? Most cities in the country have coffee shops that provide a roughly similar cup of coffee\u2014and similarly comfortable atmosphere\u2014at much lower prices. How does Starbucks make it work?\nOne major issue is culture. Since the Chinese economy opened up to import products in the late 1970s, these goods acquired a certain cachet with image-conscious consumers. \"Traditionally foreign products were regarded as better-made, higher-status, and simply nicer,\" Fei Wang, a Washington, DC-based consultant who grew up in Wuhan, told me. \"A person's social standing was defined by the objects they own.\" Far from acting as a deterrent, high prices actually enticed customers who wanted to show off their new affluence; put another way, purchasing a good like a cup of coffee at a premium was a good way to obtain \"face\" in business or personal relationships. And Starbucks had the good fortune of entering the country at a time when coffee drinking became fashionable among hip, young Chinese consumers.\nThere are signs, however, that Chinese preferences for high-priced, imported goods may be waning. With the rise of e-commerce\u2014and more frequent foreign travel\u2014Chinese consumers have begun to feel that they're paying too much for simple pleasures like a cup of coffee. \"After living in America for awhile I was shocked at how expensive Starbucks was when I went back to China,\" says Wang. This trend appears to be happening across other industries, too: A disgruntled shopper told the Wall Street Journal's Laurie Burkitt that it simply wasn't \"worth shopping in China anymore.\"\nCould the Starbucks allure fade in China, as the country's once-non-existent coffee shop market matures? Probably not anytime soon. The company has proven adept at adding local touches in its Chinese stores, such as green tea flavored coffee drinks and collectible mugs, and has shown a flexibility that has eluded other foreign companies hoping to capitalize on the market. Eventually, though, Chinese customers may decide that a latte is just a latte\u2014and the no-name place down the street is more than good enough.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: How has Starbucks adapted to the local market in China, and what measures has the company taken to maintain its appeal to customers?",

    "user_prompt": "Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material\n\nQuestion/Instruction: In what ways did Trebek's performance as moderator affect the post-debate reactions of viewers, and how might this influence the upcoming election?\n\nGiven material: Moderator Alex Trebek speaks during a gubernatorial debate between Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf and Republican Scott Wagner in Hershey , Pa., Monday, Oct. 1, 2018. The debate was hosted by the Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry.\nIt's hard to decisively win a 45-minute gubernatorial debate: There's simply not enough time to make key points and thoroughly own the issues.\nBut you can certainly lose the debate, especially if you're the moderator.\nThat's what happened Monday night at the Hershey Lodge, when Jeopardy! host Alex Trebek made a guest appearance as celebrity moderator of Pennsylvania's one and only debate between Gov. Wolf, a Democrat, and Republican Scott Wagner.\nThe debate started late as Trebek lingered on stage during a \"fireside chat\" with Gene Barr, president of the state Chamber of Business and Industry, which hosted the event. Then, when the main event finally came, the game-show host filibustered and monopolized the whole thing \u2014 which seemed fine to the front-runner Wolf but cut into Wagner's attempt to capitalize on a statewide audience for the lone debate.\nTrebek abandoned a veneer of impartiality when it came to whether Pennsylvania should impose a severance tax on natural gas drilling. Wolf has pushed the tax since he took office in 2015, but the GOP-led legislature has blocked his efforts. Wagner and other Republicans note that Pennsylvania already imposes an \"impact fee\" on drillers.\nWagner marshaled that argument Monday, but Trebek suggested it wasn't enough.\nThat was a remarkably unpopular opinion to push to the Chamber of Business and Industry crowd, which responded with boos. \"What did I tell you guys at the beginning?\" Trebek said (his one rule: no booing or hissing).\n\"If all of the voters were to believe everything you've said about each other, we'd have trouble voting for either one of you,\" Trebek told the candidates. Fair enough \u2014 voters often say they're sick of attack ads. But Trebek came across as moralizing, and it's not clear why his opinion should matter to Pennsylvania voters.\nAt one point, Trebek asked: \"Have you ever said anything negative about your opponent that you knew was not true?\"\nWagner shook his head no, and Wolf offered a lawyerlike equivocation: \"Not that I remember, no.\"\nTrebek began to frame a question about redistricting, noting that the legislature had made scores of amendments to a reform bill and suggesting lawmakers had no interest in actually changing the process.\nThen he said the only institution less popular in the Keystone State than the legislature was the Catholic Church, which, of course, has been under fire since a grand jury in August reported decades of abuse by predator priests.\nThe audience seemed to let out an audible cringe.\n\"Don't go there,\" Trebek said, before launching into a soliloquy about his time at a Catholic boarding school.\nAs Trebek moved on, Wolf interjected, to laughter, \"I don't think you quite finished on the redistricting.\"\nThe Pennsylvania Cable Network is not the place for this. If you watch PCN, you're expecting the sometimes dry and technical but important details of state government policy debate. Callers to a post-debate review show were aghast at Trebek's performance, no matter which gubernatorial candidate they supported.",

    "user_prompt": "Given the text: OTZOLOTEPEC, Mexico, April 7 (Reuters) - Under a scorching sun, Clemente Enriquez tips his wide-brimmed hat up as he proudly displays in an open palm the conico corn seeds he plants on his small plot in the rolling hills outside this village west of Mexico City.\nLately, his enthusiasm seems to be catching on. A growing army of \u201cheirloom corn\u201d fans, from celebrity chef Rick Bayless to food giants like ConAgra to a group of dogged Mexican scientists, are aiming to unlock the ancient ingredient to bring tortillas with better flavor to the high-end foodie market while boosting sustainable local economies.\nEntrepreneurs see a huge profit to be made in higher-margin tortillas and chips sold at restaurants like Bayless\u2019 Frontera Grill in Chicago and Enrique Olvera\u2019s Cosme in New York, and mass marketed at higher-end retailers like Whole Foods Market Inc. It can also boost the incomes of the poor farmers in Mexico who have been cultivating traditional maize for millennia.\nSeveral of the nearly 60 native varieties, or landraces, of this heirloom corn often grow alongside corn\u2019s ancestor teocintle, a skimpy stalk with a few meager kernels that Mexican farmers transformed in a dizzying series of improvements over some 8,000 years.\nCenturies later, their distant descendents see a bright future for the traditional grains if obstacles can be overcome.\nThe first is whether Mexican scientists can hammer out a first-ever fair trade certification for traditional corn farmers, similar to certifications for organic coffee or chocolate. Once an accord is reached, which is expected later this year, organizers say a civic association or panel of experts will provide the voluntary certification.\nAnother hurdle is the farmers themselves, many of whom are not fully versed about the value of their crops abroad, or even the specific variety of corn they tend. They also must ease their reliance on middle-men buyers known as coyotes who have long been their main sales channel and could be the losers if the crop\u2019s value is enhanced.\nIf successful, exports of Mexico\u2019s gourmet maize could start to reverse a flood of cheap U.S. yellow corn imports that have pushed more than 1 million Mexican farmers off their fields since the enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994.\n\u201cI live in GMO corn-country and it is the most tasteless corn in the world,\u201d Bayless told Reuters, referring to the sprawling fields planted with genetically modified corn around his hometown Chicago, Illinois, America\u2019s second biggest corn-producing state.\nBut the bolita variety of heirloom corn from Mexico\u2019s southern Oaxaca state is different, he says.\nThe chef\u2019s taste buds aren\u2019t lying, the maize scientists behind the certification in Mexico say.\nCommodity benchmark \u201cYellow 2\u201d corn, a grain used mostly for animal feed, has little in common with Mexican corns that come in a kaleidoscope of colors and in some cases can be traced back for centuries to a specific mountain valley, says Flavio Aragon, one of the scientists behind the certification.\n\u201cThe quality of Mexican corns is something else entirely,\u201d he said.\nEntrepreneurs putting big money on the line include Jorge Gaviria, chief executive of Los Angeles-based, privately-held Masienda, the first company to source the corn, whose ambition is to take on mass-produced tortillas with a tastier if pricier alternative.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s clearly in our sights is getting into the tortilla market in a really big way,\u201d he said.\nU.S. tortilla consumption is seen doubling to $30 billion by 2025, according to market research firm IndexBox.\nConagra Brands Inc, the maker of Chef Boyardee pasta and Hunt\u2019s ketchup, late last year bought Bayless\u2019 Frontera Foods, part of an industry trend to promote higher-margin products and boost sales as consumers crave more natural foods.\nAround the same time, Bayless launched a line of premium tortilla chips using mostly bolita sold exclusively at Whole Foods. Conagra said in a statement that the chips are \u201cperforming well\u201d but declined to provide sales data.\nThe new landrace maize certification was expected to be ready late last year, but building consensus on the fine print has caused a delay.\nOrganizers say the certification will provide farmers with a document that details the specific variety they grow, the traditional farming methods they use. It would also restrict sales to surplus supply to prevent farmers from selling what they would normally set aside for their families and animals, forcing them to turn to more processed foods in their own diets.\nLast season, Mexico produced around 24 million tonnes of corn, or about 4 percent of global output, and native corn surpluses are estimated at as much as 5 million tonnes annually.\nMasienda, which sells directly to hundreds of restaurants, began buying Mexican heirloom corn three years ago. This season, its purchases will probably reach 2,000 tonnes, up five-fold since 2014, said Gaviria.\nAt the higher end, some heirloom varieties can already fetch around three times the price of conventional corns.\nThat has farmers like 22-year-old Octavio Tejeda optimistic he can cash in on growing demand from around the world for tastier tortillas and most importantly preserve the strains.\nCan you paraphrase the section of the article that discusses how entrepreneurs see a huge profit to be made in higher-margin tortillas and chips sold at high-end foodie markets, and how the demand for tastier tortillas made with heirloom corn is increasing around the world?",

With the January influx of pupils into Form 1, new buddies were paired-up and new friendships forged. It was also lovely to see existing F7-F1 buddies greeting each other enthusiastically.\nPlanning for Book Week later this term is under way and Form 7 enjoyed some artistic licence, creating Story Cubes, which they will be using with some of the younger classes. They had to think both literally and metaphorically about what the symbols they were drawing on the faces of their cubes could mean. A lightbulb could perhaps indicate a power cut, or somebody turns the light on in the story, or maybe it could suggest that the character has a good idea. Open doors, question marks and tunnels were also popular items. The class then began to use their story cubes with partners to create inspiration for their own tales. Can you provide a summary of Form 7's recent activities, including their discussions on growth and their involvement with Form 1 students?",

    "user_prompt": "What are the potential consequences if Citgo is seized to pay Venezuela's debts, and why is it seen as a valuable asset?\nGenerate according to: As crisis-plagued Venezuela struggles to pay its bills at home and abroad, foreign creditors are circling one of the country\u2019s most valuable assets: Citgo, the Houston-based oil company that it has owned since 1990.\nIf Citgo is seized and sold to pay Venezuela\u2019s debts, it could disrupt one of the most reliable sources of cash for a country already reeling from hyperinflation, food and medicine shortages, and a population exodus. U.S. sanctions aimed at pressuring President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has overseen the worst of the country\u2019s implosion, have exacerbated the government\u2019s pain, largely blocking it from the U.S. financial system.\nThe fight over Citgo is unfolding in courtrooms and boardrooms across North America and Europe \u2014 with a key decision expected by the end of the year.\nTwo Canadian mining firms are trying to acquire parts of Citgo as compensation for Venezuela\u2019s expropriation of their assets more than a decade ago. A Russian oil company and holders of bonds issued by Venezuela\u2019s state oil producer have staked a claim to Citgo shares. ConocoPhillips suggested it may also pursue the company.\nNow the other creditors are waiting to see whether the judge allows Crystallex to begin selling those shares \u2014 which could trigger even more claims on Citgo.\nCitgo\u2019s Gulf Coast refineries are big buyers of Venezuela\u2019s crude oil. The Houston company is one of the few customers from which Venezuela can expect same-day payments, Dallen said. It is possible that a new Citgo owner would carry on buying from Venezuela with little interruption, but it\u2019s also possible that new ownership would destabilize those purchases, he said.\nPetr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the state oil company that owns Citgo, appealed the Delaware court ruling, saying it could \u201cjeopardize the financial well-being\u201d of PDVSA and Citgo. PDVSA and the Venezuelan Communication Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.\nCitgo was founded in 1910 by American businessman Henry L. Doherty and traded hands a few times before PDVSA bought full control. Citgo owns refineries in Texas, Louisiana and Illinois and pipelines and petroleum distribution terminals across the United States. The company sells fuel to Citgo-branded gasoline stations that are owned by local entrepreneurs.\nU.S. sanctions have reduced Venezuela\u2019s ability to benefit from Citgo, barring the firm from sending dividends to Caracas. The United States did not issue sanctions preventing Venezuela from selling oil to Citgo because the U.S. market depends on those imports.\nCreditors\u2019 tug of war over Citgo is unfolding as Venezuela\u2019s economic crisis deepens. Malnutrition and poverty are soaring, power and water infrastructure is failing, and inflation is rocketing toward 1 million percent. Venezuelans are fleeing their broken nation by the hundreds of thousands in the region\u2019s largest migrant crisis in decades.\nThe country\u2019s oil industry, meanwhile, is crumbling. Drill sites and pipelines are being raided by bandits and failing because of mismanagement and a lack of spare parts. Oil output has slumped to levels not seen since at least the 1950s.\nAmid the breakdown, Venezuela and PDVSA last year stopped making payments on some of their foreign debt, which probably exceeds $150 billion, according to Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America fixed-income strategy at Nomura Securities. Firm figures on the country\u2019s debt are unavailable because Caracas has stopped reporting that data, she said.\nThe country is also facing large claims from foreign companies whose mining and oil assets were nationalized under the previous government of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the leftist firebrand who died in 2013.\nIn 2016, an international arbitration panel ruled that Venezuela owed Crystallex $1.2 billion plus interest as compensation for nationalizing the Las Cristinas gold mines, a seizure that pushed Crystallex into bankruptcy.\nWith the Delaware court ruling, PDVSA was found liable for Venezuela\u2019s debts, and Crystallex was granted permission to take over the state oil company\u2019s shares in a subsidiary that owns Citgo Holding. The court told Crystallex to hold off selling the shares until it fielded objections from other parties.\nBanks and pension funds that hold $1.5 billion of PDVSA bonds secured by a majority stake in Citgo Holding have requested a delay in the share sale until the appeal is decided.\nThe Russian state-controlled oil company, Rosneft, which holds 49.9 percent of Citgo Holding as collateral against loans it provided to PDVSA, also stepped forward, saying a change in Citgo ownership could give it the right to sell that collateral.\nAnd ConocoPhillips, which is trying to recover $2 billion from PDVSA in connection with Venezuela\u2019s oil industry nationalization, asked the court to delay the share sale, saying the appeal ruling could make Citgo available to PDVSA creditors like itself.\nCitgo isn\u2019t the only Venezuelan asset creditors have pursued. This spring, after winning a $2 billion arbitration award against PDVSA, ConocoPhillips tried to seize Venezuelan crude oil in storage facilities across several Caribbean islands. The move disrupted Venezuela\u2019s crude exports and left the country scrambling to bring its tankers back into national waters to protect them from seizure.\nAndre Agapov, chief executive of Vancouver-based Rusoro Mining, said he traveled to Caracas this summer to speak with Attorney General Reinaldo Mu\u00f1oz about recovering a $1.4 billion debt related to Venezuela\u2019s nationalization of gold-mining assets.\nThis month, Rusoro said it had reached a settlement with Venezuela for $1.28 billion.\nUntil Venezuela begins paying the mining company, though, Rusoro is continuing to pursue a court case in Texas to lay claim to Citgo assets, according to Jay Kaplowitz, a lawyer for the company. That case won\u2019t be withdrawn \u201cuntil after the first payment is made,\u201d he said.",

    "user_prompt": "How has Bytedance been aggressively hiring in the US since bringing TikTok to the market?\nGenerate according to: Earlier this year, a former Snap employee who now works at another tech company received a LinkedIn message from a recruiter for a sales job. The company was described as \u201cone of the few successful content platforms powered by AI.\u201d The company had products available in more than 150 markets and in 75 languages, and its top product had more than 300 million daily active users, the recruiter said.\n\u201cVery interesting,\u201d the candidate replied, though ultimately turned down the opportunity.\nThe company was Bytedance, looking for a brand strategist role at TikTok.\nBytedance has been on an aggressive hiring spree in the U.S. since it brought TikTok, one of its apps, to the U.S. in August. The Chinese tech company had decided to merge Musical.ly, the app with a reported $1 billion price tag it acquired in November 2017, with TikTok. But for Bytedance to increase its presence in the U.S., it didn\u2019t just want to promote an app; it hired a U.S.-based team with offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Chicago. These employees are joining a global organization of 40,000 people, The Information reported. In the U.S., over the last eight months, Bytedance has hired dozens of people from digital agencies and other social apps, most notably from Snap, as it tries to build out TikTok\u2019s sales and partnerships team.\nThe former Snap employee said several of their former colleagues still at the company had been approached. Already, TikTok has hired at least 14 people from Snap, per LinkedIn. For example, Roxana Sarbaz spent more than three years in sales at partnerships before moving to TikTok in November as strategic content partnerships. Tucker King also worked at Snap for more than three years in production before moving to TikTok in January as creative development manager.\nBuyers, who have spoken with Snap and TikTok, are seeing similarities in the companies\u2019 pitches.\n\u201cThey have the same talking points. [TikTok\u2019s] pitch deck is incredibly similar, and they are hyping the lens, but TikTok is focusing on the value prop that it\u2019s more interactive than just the face, which of course we know Snap is now doing too,\u201d said a buyer.\nIndeed, TikTok and Snapchat are both apps for short-form vertical video, and they both have young, highly engaged audiences. TikTok compares itself to Snapchat in its pitch deck to U.S. agencies, obtained by Digiday. One slide shows how TikTok overtook Snapchat as the most downloaded app in the U.S. in monthly downloads. TikTok also pulls App Annie statistics from October 2018 that show while the average session on Snapchat is 80 seconds, TikTok\u2019s average session is 294 seconds. And their ad products are quite similar, with vertical video ads and augmented reality ads.\nHiring people from competitors isn\u2019t anything new, especially in tech industry. Snap hired people from Facebook and Twitter to help build its ad business and other products. One of Snap\u2019s notable hires was Sriram Krishnan, who worked on Facebook\u2019s ad product. He now works at Twitter. Snap seemed to follow Facebook\u2019s advertising playbook as it built its self-serve system. The Los Angeles tech scene, where TikTok and Snap are both based, is also quite small, though rapidly growing. Snap\u2019s and TikTok\u2019s offices in Los Angeles are about five miles from each other.\nTikTok did not respond to a request for comment. Snap declined to comment.\nA Bytedance recruiter also had reached out to an employee at Twitch for a brand partnerships role earlier this year. The recruiter described the company as a \u201cfast-growing global creation and interaction video platform, which has over 800 million daily active users,\u201d the potential hire told Digiday.\nTo grow its brand and agency relationships, TikTok has hired experts from inside agencies. Two people recently joined TikTok from VaynerMedia. TikTok also has hired from Cycle and Fetch.\nThese employees are currently promoting TikTok\u2019s current ad products and discussing future ones, media buyers told Digiday. According to TikTok\u2019s pitch deck, TikTok currently offers four ad products: brand takeover, in-feed video, hashtag challenge and branded lenses. These products can only be brought directly through TikTok\u2019s internal sales team, but the sales team has opened up to buyers about a future self-serve system.\nTikTok\u2019s recruiting efforts are far from over. TikTok has 26 open roles on LinkedIn as of April 12. These roles include a brand strategy in New York and in San Francisco as well as a head of marketing in Los Angeles.",

What ideas did these paintings convey and what components interested you and affected your overall art viewing experience. Each page should have your last name with the page number at the upper right corner. In this essay, name the title, date, artist, medium/material, the time period, and the style of each artwork. Discuss you initial reaction to the artwork and reflect upon your experience viewing the work. Describe and or explain the content in terms of the narrative, subject, concept or intention of the artist.

What did you think of the design and the layout? What new ideas do you have about art?\nArt and its marvels have always been interesting and captivating to behold. The representation of a person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s thoughts, feelings or ideas in pictorial form, is the epitome of creativity by an individual, in this case, the artist. It is sometimes difficult to have a clear preference for any piece of art, especially in a situation where there are various pieces of art, all of which are excellent in their way. Sometimes visual judgment becomes beautifully \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcimpaired,' when beholding the masterpieces of some incredible artists. This is the case when it comes to my experience with three pieces of art. These were; \"The Adoration of the Shepherds with Saint Catherine of Alexandria\" by Cigoli, \"The Vocation of Saint Aloysius Gonzaga\" by Guercino, and \"Holy Family with Saint Elizabeth, Saint John, and a Dove\" by Peter Paul Rubens.I found these pieces of art fascinating and captivating in their different ways.\nThe Adoration of the Shepherds with Saint Catherine of Alexandria, done by Ludovico Cigoli, is a painting done in 1599, and whose medium was oil on canvas. I was able to dig deeper about the artist himself, coming to learn that he was an intellectual who rubbed shoulders with the likes of Galileo Galilei. This was a piece that he did while he was at the peak of his career, and this certainly meant a condensation of brilliant ideas and skills into one great piece of art(McKee).I became even more interested in learning more from this piece of his art. His work depicted a significant degree of attention to emotional warmth while also exaggerating on color. These two were quite a new thing to the artistic society of Florence at the time, and exemplified indeed, the growth of art around the region. Based on the passage above, What was the artist's intention or concept with each of the three works, and how effectively did they convey these ideas through their formal elements?",

    "user_prompt": "How many earthquakes did Oklahoma experience in 2015 and what has been the trend since then?: Scientists may have found previously unmapped faults in Oklahoma that could be contributing to a sharp increase in induced earthquakes in the state.\nA new study used magnetic imaging to explore the rock formations below the earth's surface.\nThe apparent faults extend from what appeared to be the end of mapped faults directly to areas where many quakes occurred, Oklahoma Geological Survey Director Jeremy Boak said.\nHOW MANY EARTHQUAKES HAS OKLAHOMA HAD?\nOklahoma averaged just one magnitude 3.0 earthquake a year before 2009.\nThat number jumped to 903 in 2015, before declining to 304 last year.\nOklahoma has experienced about 80 such earthquakes so far in 2018.\n'This study really gave us some new interesting information about the orientation of faults,' Boak said.\n'You can see something in the grain and structure (of the rock) that continues that fault,' it's deeper.\nThe Oklahoma agency and the U.S. Geological Survey studied areas where four quakes of magnitude 5.0 or stronger have struck since 2011.\nA report by lead author Anji Shah of the U.S. Geological Survey was published in Geophysical Research Letters .\n'In Oklahoma, there is a grain (similar to wood grain) to the deep rocks and it is aligned in a way for the stresses to generate a 'slip,'' resulting in an earthquake, Shah told The Associated Press.\nPictured, an Oklahoma resident examines bricks that fell from three sides of his in-laws home, after two earthquakes hit the area in less than 24 hours. In a new study, scientists revealed pumping energy drilling wastewater deep and nearer fault lines is a leading cause in much of the thousands of man-made earthquakes that have hit Oklahoma in recent years.\nThat number jumped to 903 in 2015, before declining to 304 last year. Oklahoma has experienced about 80 such earthquakes so far in 2018.\nIS FRACKING TRIGGERING OKLAHOMA'S MAJOR QUAKES?\nIn the map, the size and volume of the dots correlate to the earthquake strength.\nAt first, beginning in 2004, these dots are small and sporadic.\nOver the course of the next few years, however, they become far more frequent, and much larger.\nRoughly halfway through the animation, the quakes begin to spike dramatically until the dots appear to take over nearly the entire state.\nThis reveals the startling increase in induced seismicity over the last few years, which has been linked to wastewater injection.\n'I hope we learn even more from this. We haven't had time to assimilate it yet and determine which direction we should go next,' Palmer said.\n'We don't think we can predict earthquakes, but we can prepare for them,' Shah said.",

    "user_prompt": "How does Western culture neglect the roots of history, and what is the impact of this neglect? : If we forget or choose to ignore the suffering and lessons of the past because, maybe, that would disturb our comfort and interfere with our \u201chappiness,\u201d we will lose the plot of our existence. I am not sure if it is there anymore but, before the recent major renovations, a quote attributed to the Baal Shem Tov was inscribed above the exit of the Yad VaShem Holocaust Museum in Jerusalem. The fast days and special periods of reflection in the biblical calendar help us delve intentionally into God\u2019s purposes in history; to plumb the depths of meaning both of the joys and of the tragedies and suffering of the past. As we do, we can marvel at how the ancient voices speak directly into our present reality and shine a light of understanding on today\u2019s circumstances of confusion and pain. History, as God\u2019s story, is the cord that binds his people together. It is the crucible of the past that unites us and, as we learn from it, we can be transformed and propelled into the future with a clearer vision of his redemptive purposes. If we forget or choose to ignore the suffering and lessons of the past because, maybe, that would disturb our comfort and interfere with our \u201chappiness,\u201d we will lose the plot of our existence. Without its anchor of core values and deeper meaning we will be drifting aimlessly in a shallow and meaningless sea. Western culture presents us with a perfect example. With its emphasis on youth and pressing forward without regard for, or understanding of, the roots of history, there is no awe, respect, or gratitude for what went before. Thus, as Erica Brown describes, \u201cMemorial Day [in the United States] is not observed as a mourning period for the loss of soldiers; it is a day of barbecues, sales, and public pool openings.\u201d We may notice, too, that Thanksgiving has lost its historic and spiritual meaning and has become a day of lavish and excessive turkey dinners and football. The values have been lost along with the remembrance and there is a shallowness about it all. This also can be applied to Christianity that has cut itself off from the history of its Jewish roots; and the celebrations of Christmas and Easter can be viewed in the same light. The plot has been lost. God\u2019s timeframe for history is found only in the biblical calendar. At present we are experiencing the Three Weeks of reflection and repentance, which fall between 17 Tammuz (eve of the 24th July) through Tisha b\u2019Av, the Ninth of Av (14 August). On the seventeenth of Tammuz, the walls of Jerusalem were breached and, after great suffering and the murder of her inhabitants, on Tisha b\u2019Av the Holy Temple, the House of God, was destroyed. As tragic as it was, the loss of the building itself was not the deepest sorrow. One can compare the destruction of the Twin Towers in New York on September 11, 2001. The deeper tragedy was the loss of thousands of lives\u2014each of which impacted further ripples of families and friends\u2014as well as all of us who cared with aching hearts. The loss of the visible reminder of the Presence of God, the loss of his city, a capital that stood as a spiritual heart for his people, and the exile from the land, as well as the baseless hatred\u2014of the enemy and among the people themselves\u2014that caused it; these are the reasons for mourning on Tisha b\u2019Av. While we certainly can rejoice today at the restoration of the land of Israel and her people to it, and the reclamation of Jerusalem as the capital city, the story is not yet over. The warfare and pain continue and we teeter on the brink as a result of man\u2019s forgetfulness and rejection of the ways and purposes of God. And so we mourn and repent, and pray and trust, and our hope is anchored in the mercy, compassion, and power of the God of Israel. We can simply continue to serve him in faith and he will steadily accomplish the ultimate goal of his great redemption for all the earth.

    "user_prompt": "Alice Pfaelzer and Emma Endres-Kountz founded Merit School of Music in 1979 in response to the elimination of music education from Chicago\u2019s public elementary schools. Alice and Emma devoted themselves to helping young people realize their musical talents; use their musical skills to gain access to college; and become productive, compassionate, and responsible members of society. As personal role models they demonstrated that self-esteem and success comes from hard work and achievement. For more than three decades, Merit has advanced their vision.\nMerit first opened its doors at Roosevelt University with the establishment of its cornerstone program, the Alice S. Pfaelzer Tuition-free Conservatory. The Conservatory provides advanced music instruction free of charge to Chicago\u2019s most dedicated and deserving students. In 1983, Merit produced its first \u201cPerformathon\u201d event\u2014an all-day classical and jazz concert featuring Merit\u2019s Conservatory students. The event has grown to feature hundreds of students and almost 18 hours of performances.\nIn 1984, Merit responded to requests from Chicago Public Schools to create an in-school music education program with the introduction of its Bridges: Partners in Music Program. Bridges furthers Merit\u2019s mission of accessibility\u2014reaching deep into the community to identify and support children with a desire to grow through music. Today, Bridges serves more than 2,000 students annually. In 1990, Merit instituted the Regenstein Scholarship Program to provide children living in Chicago public housing with instruments, full scholarships to Merit programs, transportation to and from classes, and mentoring opportunities.\nThroughout its history, Merit has strived to perfect a comprehensive continuum of programming that provides a clear path to musical achievement. This includes a curriculum for early childhood, beginning, and intermediate level group instruction as well as access to private lessons and performance ensembles. A robust evaluation process tracks student progress and program and instructor effectiveness, and ensures that Merit\u2019s students and their teachers have consistent goals in terms of achievement and learning.\nIn June 2005, Merit moved into its own building to accommodate its growing programs, staff, and student body: the Joy Faith Knapp Music Center in Chicago\u2019s West Loop. With more than 40,000 square feet of classroom, performance, and office space, Merit is truly a home away from home for thousands of Merit students.\nIn 2014, Merit celebrated its 35th anniversary. Now home to nearly 5,000 students on-site and off, Merit continues to provide vital access to music training, while deepening and broadening instructional offerings, and increasing financial support so that more motivated students can transform their lives through the Merit experience.\n\"My dream is to be a professional violist, and Merit is helping me to reach this goal with quality training and excellent performance opportunities.\" How has Merit grown and evolved over the past few decades, and what are their plans for the future?",

    "user_prompt": "How does referring to economics as \"physics\" help convey the idea that economic forces describe what is actually happening, rather than what people want to happen?: For quite some time now, we've been trying to convince many folks in a variety of industries, but especially the recording industry, to recognize why their rush to create and embrace business models that rely on artificial scarcity was not sustainable. What's been most amazing is how the folks in the industry themselves turn a blind eye to it (or falsely seem to accuse us of just promoting \"theft.\") However, with the recording industry continuing to struggle, it looks like insiders are finally starting to hear the message. Mathew Ingram points us to a talk given by Yahoo!'s Ian Rogers to a music industry conference last month with the title: Losers Relish Scarcity, Winners Leverage Scale. He goes on to discuss the \"physics\" of media, which is nothing more than basic economics. However, using the word \"physics\" makes sense here. For whatever reason (and economists may be at fault here), too many people still assume that economics are what people want to happen or what should happen, rather than recognizing that it describes forces that actually are happening. Talking about economics as \"physics\" helps get that point across. It's a good pitch, though my experience suggests that the important people won't listen (or, rather won't \"hear\" what's being said). While much of the industry is figuring this out, the big bosses of the record labels are still a long way from waking up to the reality they face.\nBest presentation / explanation of the road ahead for music & Video for that matter.

    "user_prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Can you summarize the proposed changes to Russia's retirement age for civil servants and what the motivations behind it are?\n\nPassage: President Dmitry Medvedev has suggested reducing the retirement age for civil servants from 65 to 60. Earlier, he suggested cutting the number of bureaucrats by 20 per cent.\nAmendments to the Law on Civil Service have been submitted to the State Duma. Currently the law sets the retirement age at 65. However, it states that civil servants performing their duties under an indefinite service contract must, upon reaching the age of 60, renew a contract for one to five years. That leads to a number of problems, according to the Kremlin website, since the parties are compelled to renew their agreement.\nThe bill proposed by the President is aimed, among other things, at resolving that complication. The draft suggests setting the pension age at 60. Meanwhile, civil servants who are willing to keep working may have their service extended by the employer, though not beyond the age of 65.\nWhat on paper looks as tangled judicial nuances is, in practice, an attempt to bring new blood into the Russian state machinery. Medvedev \u2013 the youngest ever Russian president, the modernizer \u2013 wants younger people to serve the state.\n\u201cMedvedev is a young man and it is obvious that he is shaping his team from younger representatives of bureaucracy,\u201d says Olga Kryshtanovskaya, director of the Moscow-based Center for the Study of Elites at the Russian Academy of Sciences. However, it is not that easy to say whether it is good or bad, she told RT.\nThe average age of governors appointed by Medvedev is 48, whereas before it used to be 63.\nSuch abrupt rejuvenation is being taken positively by young representatives of the political elite, while elder ones are not that happy with the changes, the expert says.\n\u201cSociologists call this process the \u2018fragmentation of elites\u2019. That is when the elite break up into different groups with opposite interests and start competing with one another fighting for a place in the sun,\u201d Kryshtanovskaya said. \u201cI very much doubt [the move] will add to Medvedev\u2019s popularity among the elderly part of today\u2019s bureaucracy. And it is no secret that politics is the business of not very young people,\u201d she went on. The average age of the political elite in the majority of countries is about 55 years \u2013 in Russia it is currently 54.\n\u201cThose in their forties are seen as youngsters in politics,\u201d the analysts stated. People come to the political scene after achieving significant results in their first profession. One needs serious political or simply life experience, she believes.\nYears ago, long before the first states appeared, councils of elders used to govern society. \u201cSo handing over the power to the young is only a risky idea,\u201d Kryshtanovskaya believes. Indeed, there is nothing good about stagnation like it was in the USSR, when people would occupy the same post for a quarter of a century, she went on.\nHowever, it is also dangerous when people move too quickly within the political elite, the analyst added. \u201cSuch intense turnover took place in Gorbachev and Yeltsin\u2019s times. As a result, these people lost support among members of political class,\u201d the expert explained. So keeping balance is crucial.\nAccording to Kryshtanovskaya, a professor of sociology, there are about 10-12 per cent of state servants aged 40, and about 30 per cent who have turned 60. \u201cSo quite a large group of people will suffer if this bill is passed,\u201d she said.\n\u201dI think the purpose of the move is obvious. Russia is a country of bureaucrats,\u201d Leonid Radzikhovsky, independent political analyst and publicist, told RT. \u201cEveryone is aware that the inability to remove officials, or the fact they [move from one place to another] for unlimited periods of time is actually a means of nourishment, fertilizer for corruption. It has to be sorted somehow,\u201d he said.\nAccording to the analyst, the method of punishing corrupt officials by law set in the Criminal Code \u201cworks, but not efficiently enough\u201d. Therefore, preventative measures are needed. \u201cSo I believe that Medvedev\u2019s proposal should be viewed in the context of such preventative measures,\u201d he said. That includes cutting the number of state servants and reducing the retirement age. Higher turnover would make people stop thinking that they can keep their job forever.\nOverall, the idea proposed by the head of state is rather positive, Radzihkovsky said.\nThe main purpose of the idea proposed by Dmitry Medvedev is, first of all, to make the system simpler, said Dmitry Polikanov, vice president of the Center of Political Studies and a member of the ruling United Russia party.\nSecondly, the move is aimed at \u201crejuvenation of staff within public administration.\u201d That is what President Medvedev and the United Russia faction were calling for. \u201cWe need new people with fresh approaches who will move on ideas of the modernization of the country,\u201d he told RT.\nAt the same time, Polikanov noted, \u201cwe should not be absolute about age and the word \u2018youth\u2019.\u201d People can be effective at different ages. \u201cWhat we are doing is just simplifying one criterion, but there are other criteria and ways to evaluate the effectiveness of one\u2019s work\u201d.\n\u201cOn the one hand, we should understand that even at 60 a person can be an effective manager and a combination of one\u2019s experience and knowledge could be in high demand,\u201d the politician said. On the other hand, he went on, in order to progress modernization, a system of promotion of people should be created in Russia.\nThe political analyst believes the State Duma will pass the amendments. However, it will take time for the changes to be seen.\n\u201cI think it is not a question of a deadline set. What is important is that the process will be launched\u2026and a way for the next generation of managers \u2013 who are now in their 40s or 50s \u2013 will be opened,\u201d Polikanov said.",

    "user_prompt": "Did the visitors get to see any manatees during their kayak tour at Round Island Riverside Park?\nGenerate according to: Family friends recently came to visit for a long weekend.\nWhen friends come to visit for a long weekend, you want to show them the best of your hometown.\nThat\u2019s exactly what my family and I did when our friends, Michael and Nicki Kelley, recently came to visit Fort Pierce from Tipton, Missouri.\nSince they enjoy kayaking their rivers back home, we wanted to show the Kelleys how we enjoy the Indian River Lagoon with kayaks and standup paddleboards.\nOur favorite Fort Pierce spots to do so are South Causeway Park and North Causeway Island Park, but we wanted to go to a good place for beginners where there\u2019s more of a chance to see manatees. So, on Friday morning, we made the drive to Round Island Riverside Park just north of the St. Lucie County line.\nThe Kelleys kayaked around the island before they tried paddleboarding. Although we didn\u2019t see any manatees as we peacefully meandered our way through shallow water, I enjoyed teaching them about different kinds of mangroves, our diverse estuary and how it once used to be a river of grass.\nAfter we worked up an appetite, we took our visitors to our traditional post-kayaking spot at Sharky\u2019s, the only restaurant on North Hutchinson Island. Not only did the couple scarf down their seafood and hamburger meals from the restaurant\u2019s extensive menu, Michael Kelley and I also enjoyed local beers in frosty mugs.\nWe gave the couple some time to rest before we headed downtown. Luckily, it was the first Friday of the month, so we got to show them our local street festival of Friday Fest, where we enjoyed even more local beers.\nBecause we ate a late lunch, we weren\u2019t hungry enough to get a full meal at my family\u2019s favorite Fort Pierce restaurant, Chuck\u2019s Seafood on South Hutchinson Island.\nHowever, I was excited to walk through our beautiful downtown and take the Kelleys to Taco Dive on Second Street for craft tacos and my obsession, \u201ctachos\u201d (nachos with tater tots instead of chips). Our visitors talked about how good the food was for the rest of the weekend.\nOn Saturday morning, we took the couple back downtown for the weekly Farmers\u2019 Market. We bought books and jewelry, and I stuffed my face with breakfast from the local vendors.\nThe Kelleys got to see our waterfront and Fort Pierce City Marina two different ways: from sunset through the early evening at Friday Fest and from sunrise through the early morning at the Farmers\u2019 Market.\nThen, we drove over the South Causeway Bridge for the ultimate tourist destination: the South Jetty. We strolled along the Fort Pierce Inlet, watching fishermen drop lines into the middle of huge schools of mullet.\nLooking toward the beach on the south side of the inlet, we spotted what appeared to be a pair of manatees. A woman watching said she actually counted six. I was more relieved than anything for our visitors to see the sweet creatures I consider to be our local mascots.\nBecause it was Saturday in the fall, we spent the rest of the afternoon watching college football. It turned out we needed that time to rest before our final day together.\nOn Sunday afternoon, we headed to our favorite beach, Fort Pierce Inlet State Park. My family and I typically don\u2019t go to the beach when there\u2019s rough surf and rip currents, but we figured we still could give our visitors a taste.\nAfter about 15 minutes of sitting on the beach, we couldn\u2019t resist going into the ocean. My dad already gave the Missourians a lesson on how to get out of a rip current, so we grabbed our boogie boards and ventured waist deep into the water.\nEach of us ended up catching at least one powerful wave that took us all the way to shore. I\u2019ll never forget the sound of Nicki Kelley breathlessly laughing in between riding waves.\nWe walked over to the north jetty, took photographs and watched the strong waves from the inlet side slam into the rocks, soaking us and our phones.\nThen, we took a boat ride at sunset on the Indian River Lagoon. We didn\u2019t see any dolphins as we typically do at that time of day, but it didn\u2019t make the relaxing experience of watching the colors change in the sky any less lovely.\nEven though we couldn\u2019t show them everything on the Treasure Coast, I took that to mean my family and I accomplished showing our friends from out of town the best of Fort Pierce.",

    "user_prompt": "From 3 \u2013 5 May 2016 the trade fairs Texprocess Americas and Techtextil North America will take place at the Georgia World Congress Center, Atlanta, Georgia/USA. Groz-Beckert will participate with its product areas Sewing and Felting.\nIn the product area Sewing, the special application needle SAN 5.2 \u2013 a further development of the SAN 5 \u2013 will take center stage. For many years the needle SAN 5 has been established for the processing of technical textiles. With the SAN 5.2, the ideal needle for the sewing of technical textiles was designed, characterized by its unique geometry. To meet the increasing demands, the SAN 5.2 was fitted with improved, new features. They include the double groove in the point area, the reinforced blade, and the larger eye. All these developments lead to a better sewing process and a secure loop formation. The larger eye allows to use thicker sewing threads without changing the needle size. Owing to these advantages, the SAN 5.2 stands for higher productivity in the sewing process, protection of the sewing material, and a uniform seam appearance.\nA service highlight of the Sewing sector is the Customer Portal with integrated online shop. The online platform offers a lot of information about sewing technology and includes a comprehensive knowledge database. Moreover, it provides a number of details about the sewing products and impressive animations of stitch formation types. Customers in the USA already have the possibility to order the desired sewing products in the integrated shop. Besides, the processing status of orders and shipments can be checked and invoices or order confirmations can be viewed.\nAnother service innovation developed and patented by Groz-Beckert is the INH (Ideal Needle Handling) process. It allows a trouble-free and time-saving handling of broken and damaged sewing machine needles. The INH quality management helps to meet the different specifications of the brand owners in a uniform procedure. Together with the customer, Groz-Beckert defines the appropriate process and puts the required equipment at the customer's disposal.\nFor example, if a high surface quality is desired, Groz-Beckert GEBECON and EcoStar felting needles are recommended. The GEBECON felting needle, that was among the top 3 of this year's RISE Durable Product Award, is characterized by an increased stability compared to a conventional standard felting needle and, at the same time, provides a high needle elasticity and produces a good surface quality in the pre-needling process. The EcoStar needle, used for intermediate and finish needling, guarantees a high surface quality of the end product. For products that require a particularly high tensile strength, the Twisted needle is the most suitable choice. Its special feature \u2013 the twisted working part \u2013 ensures a particularly efficient needling. It is used in the production of automotive textiles, geotextiles and other applications.\nFor the mechanical bonding of nonwovens, among others used for hygiene and medical products, Groz-Beckert offers jet strips in all customary dimensions and nozzle geometries \u2013 and made from different materials. At the exhibition, three jet strip version made of different materials will be presented: HyTec Standard, HyTec D and HyTec GEBEDUR. The material used for the HyTec\u00ae Standard is characterized by an excellent corrosion resistance. The material used for HyTec D additionally provides an increased stability and protects the jet strip even better. Moreover, its surface quality prevents the accumulation of dirt. The GEBEDUR version is characterized by a special treatment giving the jet strip a high surface resistance in the area of the capillary edges. This results in a long service life of the HyTec GEBEDUR jet strip, with homogeneous product properties. Based on the passage above, What are the features that distinguish the SAN 5.2 needle in the Sewing product area from its predecessor SAN 5, and what advantages does it offer?",

    "user_prompt": "Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material\n\nQuestion/Instruction: Can you continue the comparison drawn between intimate dilemmas and scientific questions in the text?\n\nGiven material: It's funny how the most intimate dilemmas can mirror the largest scientific questions. For example: Should the U.S. spend $5 billion or more on a new particle accelerator? And if so, what kind?\nThe answer will turn, in part, on the same kind of considerations that go into deciding whether you should sign up for an experimental medical protocol, take a new job, make a pass at that girl.\nHow much risk are you willing to take and at what cost?\nOn the one hand, we are a society that puts the highest premium on safety: We want cars that can't crash, relationships that can't fail. At the same time, our communal cheer is: \"Go for it!\"\nScientists face a similar dichotomy. Many big discoveries come from precise measurement and plodding observations: the beaks of finches, the motions of galaxies, the subtle loss of energy in particle collisions each in turn provided the crucial evidence for evolution, dark matter and neutrinos.\nOther discoveries, by contrast, involve expensive gambles: space missions, decoding the human genome and many findings of subatomic particles.\nOf course, big leaps also ultimately rest on the exacting collection and analysis of data. But the approach as well as style of research differs: Measure well what you think is out there versus go for broke and see what you can find that may or may not be out there.\nAccelerator physics is inherently about careful measurement. It involves pumping up subatomic particles to high energies, crashing them together and sifting through what comes out for clues to the fundamental nature of everything.\nBut even here, said UC Santa Barbara physicist Harry Nelson, \"there are the control freaks versus the wonderment people.\"\nNelson was one of a dozen High-Minded Observers invited to a recent meeting on the future of particle physics in Snowmass, Colo., to keep their colleagues from getting too comfortable with conventional wisdom. So he was only doing his job last week when he bluntly told them: \"I feel we've underperformed. . . . We're not as good as we used to be.\"\nJust why that is, he admitted, is a hard problem. But he thinks it has something to do with granting too much power to the control freaks. \"There's something lacking we once had. It [once] felt much more exhilarating.\"\nParticle physics hasn't had a completely unexpected discovery in a long time--something really off the wall, such as the 1964 discovery that some particles prefer to be left-handed. \"If you're in this for discovery, you feel a little disappointed,\" he said.\nIn some large part, that lack of surprise is testimony to the field's success. But it's also part of the pressure to \"go where our theorist colleagues have already pointed us,\" said Nelson. \"It feels like we're sort of monks copying things down from the books the theorists write for us.\"\nThat leaves the experimenters in the same position as someone looking for lost keys under a lamppost because it's the only place that's lit.\nOf course, accelerators are expensive. Taxpayers (not to mention politicians) don't want to hear the scientists say: \"We'd like to build a $5-billion accelerator, but we might not find anything new.\"\nAnd some things can be guaranteed from virtually any new machine: better measurements that lead to new theories or validation of old ones; a whole rich range of technological spinoffs. But major discoveries are another matter entirely.\nGuaranteed discovery is an oxymoron. Asking for guarantees, said Jonathan Dorfan, director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator, \"is a recipe for failure. If you're going to ask for guarantees, you're never going to reach the frontier.\"\nAnd yet, \"there is a big pressure to play it safe from our government,\" said physicist Jonathan Bagger, co-leader of a panel charged with deciding the future of the field. \"We're a very goal-oriented society.\"\nGoing for a known goal not only can preclude real discovery, it takes away much of the adventure--the reason for discovering in the first place.\nThe late physicist Frank Oppenheimer liked to tell of a mistake he made when first exploring the Colorado mountains. The first hike up a path, he'd take his time, perhaps stumbling upon a beautiful meadow or a waterfall before reaching the grand vista from the top. But when he came up again with friends, he'd rush them in such a hurry to the summit that they never had a chance to see the meadow or the waterfall, or discover something of their own.\nOppenheimer compared this to the way physics is often taught in schools, but there's also a lesson for discoverers: You can't find anything unexpected if you always know where you're going. Sometimes the shortest distance from A to B isn't the most interesting or fruitful.\nThe biggest risk may well be not to take risks at all.",

Keeping up a sound weight is straight up there too to ensure your body against the danger of sort 2 diabetes, hypertension, and cardio vascular illness.\nWhen I educate my patients to be careful regarding the sustenances they eat with the end goal to keep them looking and feeling better, I am frequently asked a similar inquiry: \u201d What are the best nourishments for me to cook with the end goal to remain solid?\u201d There is no basic response to this inquiry. What you eat is truly not as critical as how much preparing the nourishment has experienced. The expression \u201centire sustenance\u201d has turned into a family unit word nowadays, however what does it extremely mean?\nEntire sustenance alludes to nourishment that has experienced insignificant handling and is delegated supplement rich. This implies it contains vitamins, minerals, phytonutrient cancer prevention agents, fiber, protein, omega-3 unsaturated fats, and hostile to inflammatories; all the defensive characteristics nature brings to the table. The best part about entire nourishments is that they contain all these intense supplements for an insignificant measure of calories.\nHandled, refined, and quick nourishments, then again, are viewed as supplement poor because of the modest number of supplements as contrasted and the substantial number of calories they contain. It\u2019s no big surprise that a reasonable blend of entire nourishments, particularly when they are naturally developed and cooked appropriately is prescribed for weight administration and ideal wellbeing.\nThe best eating regimen at that point, is one that depends on entire nourishments with least handling paying little respect to what number of grams of carbs, protein or fat it contains. We should investigate a portion of the sustenances that are known for their entire nourishment benefits.\nNuts, Berries, and Beans, Oh My!!!!!\nThere are a couple of remarkable nourishments that are entire, genuine, and natural that are quite often solid whether utilized as increases to formulas, as a tidbit, or principle supper added substances.

Introductory es-says by Teodolinda Barolini guide the reader through the new verse translations by Richard Lansing, illuminating Dante's transformation from a young courtly poet into the writer of the vast and visionary Commedia. Barolini argues that Dante's lyric poems are early articulations of many of the ideas and themes in the Commedia, including the philosophy and psychology of desire and its role as motor of all human activity, the quest for vision and transcen-dence, the search for justice on earth, and the transgression of boundaries in society and in poetry. With splendid new English translations and commentary, this edition brings Dante's early poems to a wider audience, while providing important literary and historical context.\nRICHARD LANSING is a Professor Emeritus of Italian Studies and Comparative Lit-erature at Brandeis University.\nCan you provide a paraphrased version of the introduction to \"Dante's Lyric Poetry\" that highlights why this edition is significant in bringing Dante's early works to a wider audience and providing literary and historical context?",

Winner of the 2000 Wolgin Prize for Best Documentary, film is structured as a multi-layered emotional journey taken by four brothers and one sister to find the grave of their brother, who died in infancy, and search for information about his twin sister, who disappeared shortly after their births in 1951. \u201cLove Inventory\u201d should travel the global festival road as a sampler of the provocative contemporary Israeli cinema, and it also deserves theatrical distribution in cities with large Jewish and Israeli populations.\nSince the film\u2019s time frame almost parallels the history of the state of Israel (established in 1948), pic offers an intriguing socio-cultural context for the five protagonists who are taking an introspective look at their past while undergoing a deep psychological transformations in the present.\nSaga could have easily adopted a Pirandellian subtitle \u201cSix Characters in Search of an Author\u201d since the focus is on siblings who throughout their lives have felt that something is missing, that their family history \u2014 and hence their own personal lives \u2014 is incomplete.\nOn one level, the yarn works as a thriller in which an obsessive brother, David, gradually rallies his entire family behind his ambitious cause of finding out about their eldest twin siblings. On another more satisfying emotional level, \u201cLove Inventory\u201d works as an intense serio comedy that dissects one family\u2019s tangled web of relationships that keep changing as the search continues.\nThe Fisher\u2019s parents are Eastern European immigrants, refugees from the Holocaust who upon their arrival in Israel decided to have a large family. The mother, Mali, gave birth to twins: The baby boy died at 10 months, but there\u2019s no known grave, and the baby girl disappeared without a trace, with only rumors and bits of information that Mali periodically disclosed to her other children.\nWhen the story proper begins, the sister arrives from New York and undergoes a divorce, which explains her growing affection for her male siblings. In one of many candid moments, she\u2019s ambiguous about the haunting investigation \u2014 which takes them to numerous hospitals, cemeteries, and bureaucracies \u2014 realizing that as the only daughter she gets her brothers\u2019 undivided attention, which might change if their missing sister is found alive.\nThree of the brothers are pros: a producer-director, a lawyer and a journalist; the fourth, the baby brother, is problematic (nicknamed a meshigener, i.e. crazy), an aspiring actor who the other siblings worry about. What\u2019s beyond doubt is the love and commitment that the siblings share for each other.\nIn the course of the film, which is periodically punctuated by David\u2019s humorous and ironic narration, we get to know the siblings well, their dreams, fears and anxieties. One of docu\u2019s great qualities is its sheer unpredictability. Toward the end, the boy\u2019s grave is found and a record is finally retrieved of the baby girl\u2019s birth in an old book, erased and written over in a manner that raises serious suspicions of wrongdoing.\nStylish and technically accomplished enough to compete with documentaries shown in major festivals around the world, \u201cLove Inventory\u201d is a gem that does Israeli cinema proud.\nProduction: A Muse production, in association with Noga Communications and JCS Content. Produced by Yahaly Gat. Directed, written by David Fisher.\nCrew: Camera (color), Itzik Portal; editor, Tali Halter Shenkar; music, Amnon Fisher, Doron Shenkar; sound, Itay Elohev, Eli Taragan.

    "user_prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What are the two distinct features of red blood cells that can be compromised by genetic disorders, aging, and malaria infection, and how do these affect oxygen and nutrient delivery to organs and microvasculature?\n\nPassage: The red blood cell in the top left is infected with the malaria parasite and has developed knobs on its surface. The enlargement shows the cytoskeleton network.\nNewswise \u2014 UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. \u2013 A multidisciplinary team of researchers has received a $25,000 seed grant from the Penn State Institute for CyberScience (ICS) to develop a modeling platform to predict the deformability and morphological changes of diseased and aged red blood cells (RBC).\n\u201cThis project will offer key molecular insight into the principles underlying RBC deformability and provide rational guidance to the development of novel diagnostic sensors, anti-malaria therapies and new protocols for blood storage,\u201d said Zhang.\nZhang\u2019s co-PIs on the project are: Weihua Guan professor in the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science; Manuel Llin\u00e1s, professor of biochemistry and molecular biology in the Eberly College of Science; and Leann Tilley, professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at The University of Melbourne, Australia.\nDuring its approximate 120-day lifespan, an RBC circulates through the human body approximately one million times and frequently squeezes through narrow capillaries, demonstrating two distinct features: a discoid shape and a remarkable deformability. However, these two features can be critically compromised by genetic disorders, upon RBC aging and through infection with malaria parasites.\nLess deformable RBCs take longer to traverse through microcirculation, resulting in diminished oxygen and nutrient delivery to organs, and they can also become sequestered in the microvasculature, leading to capillary obstruction and organ dysfunction.\nIn developing their multiscale model, the researchers will build a detailed blueprint of all molecular structures within entire RBCs using advanced high-resolution 3D imaging techniques created by Tilley\u2019s group, including young and aged, healthy and diseased RBCs. The simulation results will then be validated by microfluidic experiments, where a microfluidic channel functions as a sensor that converts the RBC-channel interaction characteristics to electrical signals. A comparison of the signal strength and transit time of normal and diseased RBCs when passing through the microfluidic channels will determine the disease state of the cells.\nSuccess in predicting RBC deformability could lead to improved drug screening for malaria, reduced time and costs of novel anti-malaria drug development and extended storage time of blood through improved blood storage lesions.\nThe seed grant will foster international collaboration and support one graduate student on the project. Zhang will also identify one senior undergraduate student to help perform data analysis.\nThe ICS is one of the five interdisciplinary research institutes under the Office of the Vice President for Research, and is dedicated to supporting cyber-enabled research across the disciplines. ICS builds an active community of researchers using computational methods in a wide range of fields through co-hiring of tenure-track faculty, providing seed funding for ambitious computational research projects and offering access to high-performance computing resources through its Advanced CyberInfrastructure.\nOf the 33 proposals submitted to the ICS this year, 20 were selected for funding. This represents a major increase over the 2016 ICS Seed Grant Program, where six projects were funded. More on the 2017-funded projects can be found here.",

I wish you all a hearty compliment of 72th Independence Day.\nToday we are a day of pride for all Indians, because we were liberated today and we got rid of the British Raj. Today is a very important day for all Indian citizens. And it has been mentioned forever in history. 15 August 1947 is a historical day which reminds us of our freedom, reminds us of the patriots who gave their home, family, and their lives for their lives. The sacrifices of these patriots to their country were not useless, due to their struggle, on 15 August 1947 their motherland got independence from British rule and since then India's own.\nToday is a very important day for all Indians, whom we celebrate to remember the sacrifices of great Indian leaders, who gave their lives for the country's freedom and prosperity. Independence of India could be possible because cooperation, sacrifice and participation of all Indians was possible. We must give importance and salute to all those Indian citizens because they were the real national heroes of the country.\nSome of the great freedom fighters of India are Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Chandrasekhar Azad, Mahatma Gandhiji, Jawaharlal Nehru, Khudiram Bose, Bhagat Singh, Lala Lajpat Rai, Ashfaq Ulla Khan, Ram Prasad Bismil etc. These were all great patriots who, without regard to their own lives, fought hard for India's independence. Who struggled hard for India's independence by the end of his life. We can not even imagine those horrific moments of struggle done by our ancestors.\nEven after so many years of independence, our country is on the right track of development. Today our country is well established in the whole world as a democratic country.\nFrom 1947 till today we are celebrating with great enthusiasm and happiness. On this day, national flag is hoisted at all schools, government offices, national anthem is sung and tribute to all these great men and martyrs who have made many efforts for independence and sweets are distributed on this occasion.\nOur Prime Minister hoisted the national flag on the Red Fort in our capital Delhi. There, this festival is celebrated with great fanfare and splendor. All the martyrs are paid tribute. The Prime Minister conveys the name of the nation and many meetings and programs are organized. We must be proud to be Indian and should make our best contribution to safeguard our country's respect.\nThis is the beauty of Hindus !!",

    "user_prompt": "PALO ALTO, Calif., Oct. 22, 2018 -- (Healthcare Sales & Marketing Network) -- Eiger BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: EIGR), focused on the development and commercialization of targeted therapies for rare diseases, today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD) designation to lonafarnib in the treatment of both Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS or progeria) and progeroid laminopathies. RPD designation for progeria and progeroid laminopathies enables priority review voucher (PRV) eligibility upon FDA approval of a rare pediatric disease product application for lonafarnib for these ultra-rare and fatal genetic conditions characterized by accelerated aging in children. Eiger is collaborating with The Progeria Research Foundation in this lonafarnib program and plans to submit a new drug application (NDA) to the FDA in 2019. There is no approved treatment for progeria or progeroid laminopathies.\nThe Priority Review Voucher Program is focused on encouraging development of therapies to prevent and treat rare pediatric diseases. If an NDA for lonafarnib is approved by the FDA for progeria and progeroid laminopathies, the RPD designation qualifies Eiger, as the NDA sponsor, for a PRV upon marketing approval. The voucher, which can be sold or transferred to another entity, can be used by the holder to receive priority review for a future NDA or BLA submission, which reduces FDA's target submission review time from ten months to six months. Eiger would share 50% of the proceeds from monetization of a Priority Review Voucher with PRF to support future progeria research.\n\"We are encouraged by the agency's support for lonafarnib and the opportunities provided by the Rare Pediatric Disease designation and the Priority Review Voucher Program,\" said David Cory, President and CEO of Eiger. \"We plan to submit an NDA for lonafarnib in the treatment of progeria and progeroid laminopathies in 2019. In the meantime, we are committed to ensuring access to lonafarnib for all patients with these disorders, and plan to launch a global expanded access program by end of year.\"\nProgeria, also known as Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), is a rare and rapidly fatal genetic condition of accelerated aging in children caused by a point mutation in the lamin A gene yielding the farnesylated aberrant protein, progerin. Lamin A protein is the structural scaffolding that holds the nucleus together. Researchers now believe that defective lamin A protein makes the nucleus unstable, and that cellular instability leads to the process of premature aging in Progeria. Children with Progeria die of the same heart disease that affects millions of normally aging adults (arteriosclerosis), but at an average age of 14.5 years. Disease manifestations include severe failure to thrive, scleroderma-like skin, global lipodystrophy, alopecia, joint contractures, skeletal dysplasia, global accelerated atherosclerosis with cardiovascular decline, and debilitating strokes. It is estimated that 400 children worldwide have Progeria.\nProgeroid laminopathies are genetic conditions of accelerated aging caused by a constellation of mutations in the lamin A and/or Zmpste24 genes yielding farnesylated proteins that are distinct from progerin. While non-progerin producing, these genetic mutations result in disease manifestations with phenotypes that have overlap with, but are distinct, from progeria. It is estimated that in addition to the 400 children with Progeria, an additional 400 children worldwide have progeroid laminopathies.\nEiger is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the accelerated development and commercialization of targeted therapies for rare and ultra-rare diseases. We innovate by developing well-characterized drugs acting on newly identified or novel targets in rare diseases. Our mission is to systematically reduce the time and cost of the drug development process to more rapidly deliver important medicines to patients. Lonafarnib is our lead compound and is expected to advance into Phase 3 with a single, pivotal trial to treat hepatitis delta virus (HDV) to initiate by the end of the year. Lonafarnib is also advancing toward a potential NDA for the treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS or Progeria), expected to be submitted in 2019.

    "user_prompt": "Fast bowler Lasith Malinga\u2019s international career looks in jeopardy after Sri Lanka Cricket issued the 34-year-old an ultimatum to return home from India to play domestic cricket if he intended to be recalled to the national side.He was unsold at the IPL auction and then opted for a stint as a bowling mentor for the Mumbai Indians.\nMalinga was named for Sri Lanka\u2019s domestic Inter-Provincial one-day tournament but prior to the announcement of the squads, which gets underway on Wedensday, releasing a video from India, Malinga declined to play any domestic cricket until the IPL was over. In the video he had mentioned that he was ready to make an international comeback during the home series against South Africa in July.\n\u201cThe selectors will have to make a call in case Lasith doesn\u2019t play any domestic cricket,\u201d SLC President Thilanga Sumathipala said on Tuesday (May 1).\nSince his return from injury, the fast bowler has taken just ten wickets in 13 ODIs at a disappointing average of 62, way above his career average of 28.\n\u201cWe have informed Lasith that he has been selected. If he doesn\u2019t play the Inter-Provincial tournament, it is unlikely that the selectors will consider him,\u201d SLC CEO Ashley de Silva said, when asked as to whether the board had had any communication with the bowler. Can you summarize the ultimatum issued to Lasith Malinga by Sri Lanka Cricket and the subsequent events that followed?",

    "user_prompt": "Based on the material, what factors are contributing to the growing trend of consumers purchasing auto insurance online and what challenges do independent agents face as a result?: Auto insurance agents need to drop the Yellow Pages and go online to keep pace with the growing number of consumers checking out quotes or purchasing their policies over the Internet, a new report based on a recent roundtable discussion involving West Coast industry professionals states.\nAccording to the report, released this week by the WIAA Education & Research Foundation\u2014a nonprofit group formed by the Western Insurance Agents Association\u2014growing numbers of consumers are choosing to check out quotes and buy their auto insurance coverage online as opposed to dealing with an agent in a brick-and-mortar setting.\nThe availability of online methods for taking care of vehicle coverage needs has created a \u201cgrowing distance between the consumer and (independent agents),\u201d Michael Jans\u2014president of Oregon-based Agency Revolution\u2014told those in attendance.\nJans said there has been a major shift in the ways in which consumers shop for vehicle coverage, starting with an initial move toward online commerce that began in the mid-1990s and was made abundantly clear in a 2011 J.D. Power and Associates study that found that 54 percent of consumers buying vehicle coverage for the first time began by applying for online rate quotes.\nThree companies that have led the way in direct-to-consumer, online policy sales\u2014GEICO, Progressive and Esurance\u2014supplied more than 70 percent of online quotes in 2010, according to Jans.\nThe report bolsters a growing body of research that shows that consumers are increasingly opting to bypass agents and shop for vehicle coverage on the Web.\nFederal officials say that 70 percent of U.S. households now have access to high-speed Internet service. And a survey released earlier this year by marketing research company comScore found that about 20 percent of respondents had purchased a vehicle policy online\u2014an increase of 5 percent compared to two years ago.\nMeanwhile, the number of people who had used the services of an agent had slipped to just over 6 in 10, a 6 percent decrease from 2009.\nAccording to the WIAA Foundation report, much of the switch to online sales is happening because of changes to the high-tech communications devices that consumers use. People who are shopping for vehicle coverage on their mobile devices get search results that are more focused on their geographic location and include fewer advertisement-driven results, Jans said.\nThey also tend to be more focused than those using the Internet from their personal computers on searching for something specific, rather than just surfing the Web, Jans said.",

Revenues grew 20% YoY to Rs13.4bn (I-Sec: Rs13.8bn) led by 29% YoY growth in own / licensed brands and network expansion. FLFL plans to accelerate growth with aggressive network expansion and expects to add total 5-6 Central and 25-30 BF stores in FY19. Net debt increased by Rs0.4bn coupled with 2% equity dilution (Rs1.7bn invested by L Catterton Asia) during H1FY19 as the company incurred capex of Rs2.4bn and invested Rs0.5bn in an online venture, Koovs. FLFL plans to invest a further Rs0.9bn in Koovs and expects to incur capex of Rs4bn-4.5bn during FY19. We believe capex intensity is likely to remain high in the near term given expectations of acceleration in BF store additions, which may impact return ratios. Hence, we cut our target multiple by one notch to 14x EV/E (earlier 15x) and reduce our target price to Rs425/share (earlier: Rs470/share), based on 14x Jun\u201920E EV/E. We broadly maintain our FY19E-FY20E EBITDA and expect ~17% revenue and EBITDA CAGR each year over FY18-FY21E. Maintain ADD.\n* Revenues (including revenue from Lee Cooper) grew 20% YoY. Central and BF registered SSSG of 1% and 3.1% respectively in Q2FY19. However, adjusting for shift in festive days, SSSG in Central and BF stood at 6.7% and 12.3% respectively. Management has guided to sustain close to low double-digit SSSG in FY19. BF contribution increased by 300bps YoY to 31% to overall revenues in Q2FY19 (~35% in H1FY19). Overall, volumes grew 19% YoY in Q2FY19.\n* FLFL owned / licensed brands\u2019 revenues grew 29% YoY / 11% QoQ in Q2FY19 led by strong growth registered in key brands like Indigo Nation (+2.2x YoY), Jealous 21 (+84% YoY), John Miller and Bare (+40-45% YoY each), and Scullers and aLL (+35-37% YoY). Lee Cooper\u2019s growth was at 17% YoY. Power brands retail revenues grew 39% YoY in Q2FY19. Third-party brand revenues grew at a lower 11% YoY. Lee Cooper footwear commercial operations has started with placement of 625 LFR doors planned by Dec\u201918 and placement across >1,500 MBOs.\n* EBITDA increased 18% YoY to Rs1.23bn (I-Sec: Rs1.26bn) owing to increased contribution of own brands by 300bps led by strong YoY growth in high-margin power brands and better operating leverage. EBITDA including other income increased 19% YoY to Rs1.31bn. PAT increased 22% YoY to Rs370mn.\n* Company\u2019s retail footprint increased to 6.2mn-sqft in Q2FY19 from 6.0mn-sqft in Q1FY19. In Q2FY19, the company opened two new Central stores (Trivandrum and Mysore) and closed one while it opened seven BF stores. In H1FY19, FLFL opened three Central and 13 BF stores net.\nWe believe capex intensity is likely to remain high in the near term given expectations of acceleration in BF store additions, which may impact return ratios.

    "user_prompt": "You've always known at least one person back in high school who would sit at the back of the room and say almost nothing for the entire school year. Or probably you have been that one guy or girl who sits at the back of the classroom and never says anything for the entire school year. Whatever your stance is, Introverts exist.\nThey enjoy the company of their thoughts and prefer to listen rather than speak, they tend to be shy and have only a few close friends. What if I told you introversion is developed over time, it does not burst out of the ground fully grown and it is nurtured until it becomes what it is most people are familiar with.\nIntroversion can be created by the people around you as you grow up. Your belief of your own capabilities and strenghts is a powerful enabler of extrovertive behavior, on the other hand, if people around you are doubtful, you yourself could become doubtful. Over time that doubt is developed into shyness, a major sign of being an introvert.\nA traumatic experience such as humiliation, or sometimes even something worse, can cause a person to become weary around others. Over time, with repeated cases (in extreme cases one time is enough) they may develop a subconscious habit or even a conscious choice to minimalize conversation and company of others in fear of being judged, fear of being humiliated and fear of something happening again.\nNot being taught how to make friends. Sounds pretty tragic, but there are cases where a person is an introvert because they never learned how to socialize and make friends with other people. The process is slow, they may try to learn for their own but fail, in time, they may become introverts.\nPeople who enjoy thinking heavy thoughts are usually introverts. That's where the link is made. Over time due to enjoying profound thoughts, one chooses to lessen contact with others and focus on their thoughts. You can also apply this to workaholics, spending much working instead of socializing with their co-workers.\nThere are times when money can get in the way of socialization. Differences in social class, money to spend on trips and dinners can make someone avoid social events and become more introvertive.\nAll of the past examples don't make you an introvert quickly, this one is no exception. Introverts are the way they are because they got used to it after being rejected, socially awkward or simply because they could not find the will or the means to socialize with other people. Years of being the same put the shell around them and gave them the branding of Introvert.\nBeing an introvert is not all bad. By the way, I myself am one. As an introvert, you have more time to spend on yourself and your needs, you have more time to think profound thoughts, and the few friends you do have are the most loyal ones. Being an introvert is developed over time, I hope this article helped you find out if you are on the path to introversion. Based on the passage above, Can you summarize the main points of the article on how introversion is developed over time?",

    "user_prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What was Operation Forward Together and what was Maj. Gen. William Caldwell's claim about the murder rate in Baghdad during August?\n\nPassage: BAGHDAD, Sept. 7 -- Baghdad's morgue almost tripled its count for violent deaths in Iraq's capital during August from 550 to 1,536, authorities said Thursday, appearing to erase most of what U.S. generals and Iraqi leaders had touted as evidence of progress in a major security operation to restore order in the capital.\nSeparately, the Health Ministry confirmed Thursday that it planned to construct two new branch morgues in Baghdad and add doctors and refrigerator units to raise capacity to as many as 250 corpses a day.\nThe morgue expansion plans and the final body count for August show the dramatic surge in violence in Baghdad since U.S.-led foreign troops entered Iraq in 2003. Baghdad's morgue chiefly handles unidentified gunshot victims, now predominantly shot execution-style and often found with hands bound and showing signs of torture.\nSince the spring, as sectarian violence has mounted, monthly counts of civilian casualties have reached the highest levels of the war, topping 1,800 at the Baghdad morgue in July. At least 3,438 Iraqis were killed across the country that month, according to Iraqi government figures, nearing the total of roughly 5,000 for the entire first year of the war.\nIn 2002, before U.S.-led forces entered Iraq, the Baghdad morgue averaged 15 shooting victims a month, morgue officials have said.\nGianni Magazzeni, chief of the U.N. human rights office in Iraq, which tracks casualty figures from Iraq's government, confirmed Thursday that the government-run Baghdad morgue had reported 1,536 dead for August.\nBombing victims and many others who die violently in Baghdad are taken to the city's hospitals rather than the morgue. The figures announced Thursday do not include those killings, or killings outside Baghdad and its surrounding towns. A complete countrywide toll is due from the Health Ministry later this month.\nAt the end of August, Baghdad's morgue initially reported receiving 550 bodies during the month. U.S. military and Iraqi government officials hailed what they said was a massive decrease in violence, calling it a sign of the success of Operation Forward Together. The joint U.S.-Iraqi security push had placed at least four of Baghdad's most violent neighborhoods under cordons and search operations, which were welcomed by many residents as bringing a relief from violence.\nThe U.S. military had called in units from Germany and Kuwait and postponed the scheduled return home of an Alaska-based unit for the bid to return peace to Iraq's capital in the fourth year of the U.S. occupation. U.S. Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad called it the Battle of Baghdad and said it was essential that American forces win it, although U.S. commanders cautioned that the work would take months rather than weeks.\nBy late August, Maj. Gen. William Caldwell was claiming a 46 percent decrease in the murder rate in Baghdad for that month. \"We are actually seeing progress,\" Caldwell said at the time. A U.S. military Web site on Thursday continued to assert a roughly 50 percent drop in killings in Baghdad.\nA U.S. military spokesman in Baghdad, Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, said Thursday that the U.S. figures were based on the military's \"consolidated reporting with the Iraqi government.\" Johnson also disclosed that the military's numbers included only \"individuals targeted as a result of sectarian-related violence, to include executions,\" and did not include \"other violent acts such as car bombs and mortars.\"\nJohnson said he did not track the morgue's figures and could not account for the substantial gap between the military's count for August killings and the latest figures from Baghdad's morgue.",

    "user_prompt": "What is the State Department's reason for proposing to release most of the records in a single batch, and why did the federal judge reject this plan?\nGenerate according to: Hillary Clinton on her emails: I want them out, too!\nShe says she has limited say over timetable while judge orders rolling release of emails.\nHillary Clinton and the State Department on Tuesday insisted they are not slow-walking the public release of her emails during her time as secretary of state, while a federal judge ordered up a plan for a rolling release of the hotly anticipated documents.\n\u201cNobody has a bigger interest in getting them released than I do,\u201d Clinton said to reporters in a rare instance of fielding press questions on the campaign trail.\nThe 55,000 pages of emails have become the source of much heartburn, speculation and bureaucratic man-hours since news emerged earlier this year that Clinton used a private email server during her time as secretary of state.\nThe controversy has complicated the roll-out of Clinton\u2019s presidential bid and played into criticism that she and her husband are unduly secretive.\nClinton said in March that she wanted the State Department to release the emails, and since then, the agency has assigned 12 staffers full-time to reviewing the Clinton emails, according to an official.\nThe State Department on Monday night proposed a deadline of January 2016 to complete its review and publicly release the whole set of documents, but a federal judge on Tuesday rejected such a plan.\nU.S. District Court Judge Rudolph Contreras on Tuesday said in a written order State must propose a new schedule by next Tuesday that involves disclosing the records batch-by-batch on a regular basis and updating the court every 60 days on the releases.\nWith the email controversy freshly swirling around her on the campaign trail, Clinton took a few questions from reporters on Tuesday \u2014 the first time she had done so since April 21, much to the jeers of her Republican opponents.\nShe contended she has limited say over the timetable.\nState spokesman Jeff Rathke said Tuesday that the agency will abide by the judge\u2019s order.\nRathke reiterated State\u2019s position that its initial proposal to release most of the records in a single batch was driven by a desire to ensure all the emails are handled appropriately.\n\u201cWe have a large volume of records that cover the entire span of Secretary Clinton\u2019s time at the department. I\u2019m sure you could imagine this would cover pretty much any topic. It could cover any topic on our foreign policy agenda,\u201d the spokesman said.\nThe emails have also been a subject of intense interest from a House committee investigating the Benghazi attacks, and documents unearthed as part of that probe have slowly leaked out.\nSome of the emails revealed that Clinton forwarded unsubstantiated intelligence on Libya from Sidney Blumenthal, a family ally, to top officials at the State Department, according to documents obtained by The New York Times.\nBlumenthal, a longtime Clinton family counselor and, according to the Times, an employee of the Clinton Foundation at the time, sent the intelligence reports based on information he had gathered while working as an adviser to Constellations Group, a private consultancy.\nClinton\u2019s habit of forwarding the memos to top advisers like Jake Sullivan and Chris Stevens, the ambassador who was killed during the 2012 attacks, raised questions among committee members about the extent of Blumenthal\u2019s influence at State \u2014 considering that aides cast doubt on the credibility of the memos in several emails.\nAt a brief hearing on Tuesday on a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by Vice News, Contreras did not set a specific date by which State must begin releasing the emails.\nHowever, the judge gave the government one week to provide a schedule for the periodic release of records, Vice News lawyer Jeffrey Light said after the session.\nContreras also gave State one week to say exactly when it plans to release a portion of the records relating to the deadly attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, as well as other Libya-related issues. State officials have previously pledged to release those emails \u201csoon\u201d but have never offered a specific date.\nThe State Department has said the release is taking a while because it must thoroughly review the Clinton emails for sensitive information typically removed from records before they are released under FOIA. State official John Hackett said in the declaration filed Monday night that the agency wanted to post the bulk of the records online at once in order to make sure the FOIA rules and policies are consistently applied.\n\u201cThe Department intends to post the releasable portions of the collection at the conclusion of its review process, which will facilitate consistency in the application of FOIA exemptions and the public\u2019s access to and understanding of the documents,\u201d Hackett wrote in the Monday document.\nClinton has said she turned over all messages that were arguably work-related but decided to delete a roughly equal number of messages that her lawyers determined were personal or private in nature.\nThe State Department could also face deadlines to disclose portions of the records in other FOIA suits. Last week, a judge ordered State to release records from Clinton\u2019s top aides on specific topics by September. It\u2019s unclear whether the requests in that case, brought by conservative group Citizens United, would encompass some of the Clinton emails.",

    "user_prompt": "Can you provide examples of some of the entries in the long title sequence of Chiasson's collection and explanations of their meaning? Answer according to: Dan Chiasson, hailed as \u201cone of the most gifted poets of his generation\u201d upon the appearance of his first book, takes inspiration for his stunning new collection from the Historia Naturalis of Pliny the Elder.\n\u201cWhat happens next, you won\u2019t believe,\u201d Chiasson writes in \u201cFrom the Life of Gorky,\u201d and it is fair warning. This collection suggests that a person is like a world, full of mysteries and wonders\u2013and equally in need of an encyclopedia, a compendium of everything known. The long title sequence offers entries such as \u201cThe Sun\u201d (\u201cThere is one mind in all of us, one soul, / who parches the soil in some nations / but in others hides perpetually behind a veil\u201d), \u201cThe Elephant\u201d (\u201cHow to explain my heroic courtesy?\u201d), \u201cThe Pigeon\u201d (\u201cOnce startled, you shall feel hours of weird sadness / afterwards\u201d), and \u201cRandall Jarrell\u201d (\u201cIf language hurts you, make the damage real\u201d). The mysteriously emotional individual poems coalesce as a group to suggest that our natural world is populated not just by fascinating creatures\u2013who, in any case, are metaphors for the human as Chiasson considers them\u2013 but also by literature, by the ghosts of past poetries, by our personal ghosts. Toward the end of the sequence, one poem asks simply, \u201cWhich Species on Earth Is Saddest?\u201d a question this book seems poised to answer. But Chiasson is not finally defeated by the sorrows and disappointments that maturity brings. Combining a classic, often heartbreaking musical line with a playful, fresh attack on the standard materials of poetry, he makes even our sadness beguiling and beautiful.\nLove Natural History?

Answer according to: Learn how to maximize your AUTHORITY and VISIBILITY on LinkedIn.\nThis is the same Cheat Sheet and Reference Guide we give to our paid certification students. Get it free.\nRemarketing is a method of using pin-point advertising to stay in front of known prospects, or even those who anonymously visited your website.\nYou\u2019ve probably experienced remarketing when you were shopping on Amazon, then left without buying. Later that day, while you were visiting a completely different website, you saw an ad for the exact thing you were looking at on Amazon. This is remarketing.\nWhat happened is that Amazon digitally tagged you when you visited the site. With digital tagging, you don\u2019t identify the individual. Instead you identify their phone or their computer, and tag it by using remarketing code (tracking pixel) to add a cookie to your prospects device.\nThe prospect remains anonymous, but the cookie enables 3rd party sites to identify their site visitors as being your prospects and show them your ads. This tactic allows you to repeatedly stay in front of your known prospects, and keep them moving in the right direction.\nAccording to ComScore, this method of targeting produces better response than any other method of targeting.\nThis is a powerful branding tool, AND a proven way to bring people back to our sales pages.\nYou can leverage the remarketing platforms at Adwords and Facebook only once you have a remarketing audience. Your remarketing audience can be imported into the ad platforms from a list. An audience can also be created over time, as people visit your website.\nIf you have a list of good prospects, you can get started on this anytime. We\u2019ll cover the tactic in some detail later. The reason I mention it here in this section is because the tagging process is a form of a handshake. Besides that, it can take time to accumulate a remarketing audience.\nIf you plan to remarket to your website visitors, you need to start tagging them now.\nYou will want to setup audience tracking on both Facebook and Adwords.\nMarketing instructor, Benny Traub, is available to help.

They have helped with attendant care services, finding assistive technology and providing training to use it, and support for me as I work toward starting my own business. The people working for them have been great and make an extra effort.\nIn December 1953, a devoted group of parents, led by John P. Kessler, Sr., whose son had cerebral palsy, came together to forge a better life for their children with CP. The group sought to make significant changes in the public perception of children with disabilities, while striving to improve their quality of life. Their efforts led them to form a therapy clinic for children with CP at Polyclinic Hospital in Harrisburg. The clinic eventually became the CP Center; it relocated to Market Street in Camp Hill in 1955. There the staff provided a classroom program and therapies for children with CP.\nIn the 1960s, the CP Center became United Cerebral Palsy of the Capital Area and the scope of the mission expanded to serve children with all types of disabilities. An array of services for adults was added during the 1980s and 1990s, as was the creation of the assistive technology department. In August 2000, the name was legally changed to United Cerebral Palsy of Central Pennsylvania, Inc., or UCP Central PA. What began as a therapeutic service for children with cerebral palsy has evolved over the past 60 years. But the organization has remained true to the Kessler family\u2019s original purpose: to forge a better life for those with special needs.\nBegan providing therapy services for children; started volunteer-run child care center; implemented community-supported youth program.\nSeventy-five percent of the operating budget comes from the United Fund (currently known as the United Way); started a Courage Club day program for adults with disabilities.\nProvided services to more than 100 children and adults with disabilities; established the only federally funded child care center for children with disabilities in Central PA; received an award for sustained performance, breadth, and growth of service from the state affiliate, UCP of PA.\nProvided center-based Early Intervention (therapy) services; established Adult Day Programs in three counties and opened three Community Homes in Cumberland County; implemented the Assistive Technology Program; began coordination of in-home supports to help people with disabilities remain in their home and local community; $300,000 in revenue, 40 staff, 120 consumers (1983).\nOpened the Capital Area Children\u2019s Center to enhance our ability to provide Early Intervention, child care and preschool services; implemented Family Support Services and the Summer Recreation Program; $2 million in revenue, 99 staff, 810 consumers (1993).\nProvided 11 Adult Day Programs throughout five counties; expanded philosophy of Adult Day Programs to include concept of a neighborhood focus; opened Hope Springs Farm; in 2006, established the UCP Foundation of Central PA, a 501 (c)3 nonprofit foundation and Type 2 supporting organization of UCP Central PA; $16 million in revenue, 480 staff, 2,400+ consumers (2007).\nProvides community and center-based programs and services in 17 Central PA counties.\nOperates 44 facilities, including 19 adult day programs in five counties, 17 community homes and 12 apartments, and community support services (three locations in three counties).\nChanging Hands program now provides hundreds of assistive technology devices and home medical items more than 200 local individuals and families, free of charge.\n-Opened new Alternatives adult day program in Milton (Northumberland County).\n-Expanded Pathways program to Cumberland and Northumberland Counties.\n-Opened new Alternatives adult day program in Lemoyne (Cumberland County).\nOpened three new community homes in Mifflintown, Lewistown, and Beaver Springs.\nExpand services for children and adults with Autism.\nAddress the unmet and evolving needs of individuals with disabilities in the Central Pennsylvania community.\nAt the federal, state, and local level, advocate on behalf of individuals with disabilities and their families.\nProvide a range of options for individuals with disabilities to secure meaningful employment.\nProvide opportunities for children and adults with disabilities through the creation of accessible playgrounds and fitness trails in Dauphin and Cumberland Counties.\nExpand Community Home and Supported Living programs.

That's one in every 113 people \u2014 or 24 people every minute. And very few found places to resettle.\nA boy looks on behind a net at the refugee camp of Schisto in Athens, Greece, on June 8.\nThe number of refugees, asylum-seekers and internally displaced people around the world has topped 65 million, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said Monday.\nAs of December 2015, there were 65.3 million displaced people, according to a report from the refugee agency. It's the first time in the organization's history the number has surpassed 60 million \u2014 and represents a nearly 10 percent increase over last year's total, of 59.5 million.\nThat number represents \"immense human suffering,\" a UNHCR press release says.\nOne in every 113 people on Earth has now been driven from their home by persecution, conflict and violence or human rights violations.\nTwo other ways to wrap your mind around that number: Each minute, 24 people around the world flee their home because of violence or persecution. And if the world's displaced people were their own nation, it would be larger than the United Kingdom.\nThe report tallies the number of refugees under the UNHCR's mandate, as well as those seeking asylum in other countries and internally displaced people (who have been driven from their homes, but remain within their own country's borders).\nAn escalating humanitarian crisis in Yemen, ongoing violence in northern Nigeria and persistent conflict in Colombia have contributed to the rising number of internally displaced people, while the war in Syria drove an increase in refugees.\nThree countries \u2014 Syria, Afghanistan and Somalia \u2014 accounted for more than half of the refugees under the U.N.'s mandate.\nAnd most of those refugees, 86 percent, are hosted in developing countries. Lebanon hosts 183 refugees for every 1,000 inhabitants, the highest ratio in the world, while Turkey hosts the highest total number of refugees \u2014 2.5 million people.\nMore than half of the world's refugees in 2015 were children, the report finds.\nA little more than 200,000 refugees were able to return home in 2015. Meanwhile, just 0.66 percent of the world's refugees were approved for resettlement in another country.\nDisplaced Iraqis stand outside their tents at a new camp set up to shelter civilians fleeing violence in the northern city of Mosul, on May 9, in Debaga, in northern Iraq.\nThe level of forced displacement worldwide is \"unprecedented since the founding of the UN itself,\" High Commissioner Filippo Grandi said in a statement.\nEvery year Grandi's agency publishes a report on displacement statistics to mark World Refugee Day.\n\"And each year,\" Grandi wrote, \"UNHCR seeks to find a glimmer of hope ... to show that the world is finding solutions to help heal the trauma refugees are living through on a daily basis.\n\"But this year the hopeful signs are hard to find,\" he said.",

    "user_prompt": "Given the text: Plans are in the pipeline for the opening of a \u2018Doha Fintech Hub\u2019, which resulted from meetings between Swedish financial technology (fintech) institutions and the Qatar Central Bank (QCB) and Qatar Development Bank (QDB).\n\u201cWe are very happy to see fruitful results from our close cooperation with Qatar in this area, having engaged both QDB and QCB in study visits to Swedish fintech institutions and their respective counterparts in Sweden,\u201d Swedish ambassador Ewa Polano told Gulf Times on Tuesday.\n\u201cSuch a concrete result is the soon-to-be opened Doha Fintech Hub, which was announced after the successful visit of the QDB and QCB delegation to Sweden in October 2017,\u201d she continued.\nThe QCB and QDB delegation\u2019s trip to Sweden last year was followed up with another visit to the Swedish Central Bank (Riksbank) and Stockholm-based fintech companies last month, Polano said, adding that the Riksbank visit was focused on the regulatory responsibilities of central banks.\n\u201cA major focus during the visit to Stockholm was knowledge sharing in financial technology, which is currently a prioritised area for Qatar Central Bank. The QCB has recognised that for financial technology startups to succeed in Qatar, a beneficial regulatory environment is needed,\u201d she further said.\nPolano also said the founder and CEO of UBI Global, business innovation expert and Swedish entrepreneur, Ali Amin, was in Qatar last week to discuss with QDB the planned \u2018World Incubation Summit\u2019 slated in Doha next year.\n\u201cDuring these discussions between QDB and UBI Global in Sweden, and their continued contacts during the last months, it has been planned that the next \u2018World Incubation Summit\u2019, organised by UBI Global and hosted by QDB, shall take place in Doha in October 2019 and includes international speakers, workshops and panel discussions, and tours of local innovation hubs,\u201d Polano said.\n\u201cUBI Global\u2019s business idea is to assemble business incubators and accelerators worldwide into a network where members can participate in benchmarking and ranking research and gain best practices to help them grow their startups. Through this innovation community, UBI Global uncovers business opportunities for corporations, governments, and investors such as competitions and events,\u201d the ambassador continued.\nPolano also said Swedish exports to Qatar for January to June 2018 (QR343.8mn) \u201cremained largely unchanged\u201d compared to the same period in 2017, while Swedish imports from Qatar is up 137% for the same period.\n\u201cTrade between the two countries is increasing steadily and very impressively from Qatar to Sweden. The numbers for Qatar-Sweden bilateral trade are by far the most impressive compared to other countries in the Gulf area, which shows Qatar\u2019s rapid development since the beginning of the blockade, after which, direct trade between Sweden and Qatar has become increasingly important,\u201d Polano emphasised.\nCan you paraphrase the ambassador's comments on the importance of a beneficial regulatory environment for financial technology startups to succeed in Qatar?",

    "user_prompt": "The big-screen adaptation comes as part of a development deal with CBS, which plans a TV pilot reimagining.\nLionsgate plans a MacGyver movie reboot as part of a development deal with CBS.\n21 Jump Street's Neal Moritz and original MacGyver creator Lee David Zlotoff will produce the MacGyver reimagining for Lionsgate, the studio announced Friday morning during an analyst call. The movie reboot is part of a development partnership with CBS as that network plans its own TV pilot adaptation to come from scribe Paul Downs Colaizzo, with Henry Winkler executive producing.\nThe development deal will see CBS take the lead on the TV reboot, while Lionsgate oversees the movie adaptation. The original MacGyver series ran for seven seasons and 139 episodes, spanning two TV movies on ABC in 1994.\nLionsgate vice-chairman Michael Burns during the analyst call also downplayed current talks on a possible merger between the studio and Starz. Burns said Lionsgate has traditionally done \"disciplined\" and accretive strategic acquisitions, and would not compromise on a possible Starz combination.\n\"Unless we thought something made a great deal of sense to us from an accretive standpoint, and ... unless we thought there were synergies, I wouldn't expect us to do any deal,\" he said during the call. Lionsgate CEO Jon Feltheimer also hit back at Bernstein analyst Todd Juenger for indicating in an investors note this week that the studio was \"cheap\" as well as patient in its acquisitions strategy.\n\"I wasn't sure if that was a compliment or not,\" Feltheimer said of the frugality claim. \"But I would say that any transaction that goes forward and any merger with a stock component to it, that transaction has to recognize not only the value of the company that is the target, but also the value that we bring to the party, the value of our synergies.\"\n\"If you think that's being cheap, or being smart, that's been part of our strategy in M&A from the beginning,\" Feltheimer added. The morning call also addressed the weaker-than-expected box office performance of The Hunger Games: Mockingjay \u2013 Part 2, which faced headwinds in Europe from the Paris terrorist attacks fall-out and a crowded theatrical market in China.\n\"Last Witch Hunter did better in China than Mockingjay 2, very much because of the date and the competition,\" Feltheimer told analysts. Looking forward, Patrick Wachsberger, co-chair of Lionsgate's Motion Picture Group, was bullish on the upcoming Gods of Egypt theatrical release in the face of speculation that the tentpole could also underperform.\n\"We have a great financial model on this film, and we're expecting solid performance,\" he said.

Western Transportation Institute Program Manager David Kack said the need for more bus routes keeps increasing day by day.\n\u201cI think over the next couple of years, with the growth in both communities, there is going to be a push to really find some funding to have some increase in service,\u201d said Kack.\nKack said Streamline is looking to add more stops out to the northwest part of Bozeman where the new high school will be open in the next year. In Big Sky, Kack said two-thirds of the workers commute into town because of the cost of living, resulting in an increase of traffic on Highway 191. To try and decrease this, as well as give people a reliable ride to work each day, the bus service needs to add more routes to and from Bozeman at more frequent time periods.\nThe cost of these updates isn\u2019t cheap. Kack said the price tag would be near $1 million each to get all of the routes and stops added.\n\u201cI hope people see the benefits of transit and as we have discussions with a lot of partners that they will be willing to step and invest some in public transportation,\u201d said Kack.\nStreamline and Skyline\u2019s annual budget is about $2 million, meaning the cost of the expansion is about half each system\u2019s budget. The money for this budget comes from groups like the Montana Department of Transportation, Montana State University, the city of Bozeman, and Big Sky Resort. Kack hopes all partners can come together and give their portion in order to fill the need.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: How does the cost of living in Big Sky affect transportation and what can be done to address this issue?",

    "user_prompt": "How can the Slides, Outline, and Notes features in PowerPoint help us in organizing and delivering informative presentations?: In this lesson, we\u2019ll be looking at the different PowerPoint guides.\nThere are two main guides in PowerPoint\u2014these are the Notes, Slides and Outline features. In this lesson, we\u2019ll be discussing all three and how they can be used to help make your life easier when making presentations. In general, these guides are in place to help keep your slideshow organized. They also help you get ready for the sometimes nerve-wracking feat of presenting by showing you a clear picture of how your slides, ideas and bullet points are arranged so that you can either retain this arrangement or change it, depending on your need. In this part of our class we\u2019ll be looking at these different features and showing you how to use them.\nThe slides feature is the left-most bar in your PowerPoint window. It shows you an overview of the slides which you have so far. This helps you keep track of how long your slideshow is as well as look at how the layout of your slide looks. This will help you ensure that your slides are consistent. When dealing with images, this also allows you to see whether or not your images (depending on their size) will show up once you view your slideshow.\nThis feature helps you keep track of the titles of your slides\u2014it helps you monitor the flow of your ideas throughout the presentation. This makes it easier for you to make sure you haven\u2019t skipped anything and that your slides are sequenced correctly. It also helps you avoid confusing different slides you\u2019re editing (this can very easily happen especially if you\u2019re editing numerous slides) by highlighting the slide you\u2019re currently working on in bright blue.\nThe Notes feature helps you keep track of things which you need to mention during your presentation or which are tangentially relevant to your topic but isn\u2019t included in the actual text of your slides. This helps you deliver slideshows which are informative. Conversely, it can also help you keep track of things which you shouldn\u2019t mention in relation to the slides. This is helpful because the notes don\u2019t show up when it\u2019s time to view the slideshow. It\u2019s only visible when you open the PowerPoint file for editing.\nIn this lesson, we were able to discuss why PowerPoint\u2019s easy-to-use guides are important when preparing slideshow presentations. We were able to look at guides which help us with our presentation\u2019s layout and alignment (Slides), flow (Outline) and information (Notes). We were also able to point out where in the PowerPoint window these features are located, making it easier for us to get to them once we begin making our own slideshows.\nNext we\u2019ll be discussing the different views which PowerPoint offers. This will help us distinguish the different ways in which we can look at our presentation and how these different viewing options are useful to us as PowerPoint users. We will also be pointing out how to access these different options.",

No time to be me. Wow, I really like this poem. Very well written. It's so true that our lives can get so consumed with rushing around doing the things that have to be done, that we are not always able to fully enjoy life itself and the things we are truly passionate about. It reminds me of the quote: \"Do more of what makes you happy.\" This is why I put my life back into perspective. My work had taken over the last five years of my life and when I finally stopped to take a break I found I never had time for me. I've since put work third, behind my family and writing. Great poem. That will make a good song. Add a melody and mass produce this poem. :) I like it... And it's frightfully accurate.

Increasingly, our lives have become a hideous balance of obligations: both personal and professional. As a result, we are traumatized into being something other than what we would like.

After we parked the car and walked around a bit, I noticed a very large crow in the parking lot, I was blown away by how large and relaxed it was. It could've been a crow. Either way, I couldn't get over the beauty of this black bird.\nThe natives of the Pacific Northwest revered the crow, as do many cultures. They are prominent in the totem poles and mythology of the Squamish natives.\nPerhaps one of the most amazing qualities of the crow family of birds is how incredibly intelligent they are, and I do believe this is the major reason why they figure prominently in mythology. Crows remember and connect with us, such as the little girl that kept bringing a crow food so the crow in return brought gifts for the little girl. They can carry messages across long distances - distances as far as death.\nWhat has your interaction been with the crow? Has it been positive or negative?

    "user_prompt": "Now, you may be asking what Pho is. To simplify it, it is basically a Vietnamese Noodle Soup with your choice of toppings and a flavorful, deep broth. I was inspired by the complexity and flavor of the broth, which is meaty and contains spices such as star anise, corriander, and clove. If you have it with beef, the boiling broth actually cooks the meat (which is super cool!). You get the broth, thin noodles, and other toppings (such as bean sprouts, basil, cilantro, Hoisin, etc)! When I got back, I decided I would try to make Pho.\nIt was then that I realized I didn\u2019t have 3 hours to boil broth and extract flavor out of meat bones.\nBut alas, I was desperate for Pho! I decided to try and make a simplified version; that, my friends, is how I created this Vietnamese-Inspired Beef Noodle Soup.\nThis dish is packed with pure deliciousness! The first thing that hits you is the aroma from the spices, which brings to mind a \u201cclean\u201d feeling. I really don\u2019t know how else to explain it. It is such a zen and calming dish, and with every spoonful your taste buds are just loved with complexity and depth. Then, you take a spoonful of the broth, with a subtle beef and onion flavor and just a tiny hint of ginger. The rice noodles are tender, and a bite of the thinly sliced beef adds a richness and decadence to this very healthy and satisfying dish.\nIf you are hesitant, still try it! You will love it, trust me! Also, make sure not to leave out any of the ingredients because each one really does play a pivotal role in balancing the flavors.\nMeanwhile, begin heating beef broth and vegetable broth in a large pot. Put the coriander, cloves, star anise, and cinnamon into the tea strainer (or other holding device) into the broth. Bring to a boil. Add the charred onion and ginger and reduce to a simmer for 30 minutes, occasionally stirring. What are some of the toppings that can be added to Pho soup?",

Leroy Comrie (D-St. Albans), Todd Kaminsky (D-Rockville Center) and Elaine Phillips (R- Mineola), as well as Assembly members Clyde Vanel (D-Queens Village) and Michaelle Solages (D-Valley Stream), listened to residents\u2019 various requests about what ESD should include in its plans for the site at 2150 Hempstead Turnpike in Elmont.\nMany residents assume Empire might designate the area for two sports teams after the New York Islanders NHL team\u2019s unpopular move to Barclays Center in Brooklyn from Nassau Coliseum and the New York Cosmos\u2019 failed 2012 bid for space .\nRussian billionaire Mikhail Prokhorov, who owns the Barclays\u2019s building, projected as far back as January that the hockey team would not add to the center\u2019s revenue and many fans had issues with the viewing area. This resulted in fewer than 13,000 people attending games in an arena with 18,000 seats, according to Bloomberg.com.\nResidents from Queens Village, Cambria Heights, Elmont and the neighboring Floral Park were not pleased by the idea, insisting a sports arena would create low-paying jobs in security, ushering and groundskeeping. Denizens from further towns in Nassau County or other boroughs were more worried about losing the Islanders, however.\nSome of the 25 Islander fans who were present came from Uniondale, Garden City and Manhattan, according to the speakers\u2019 list provided by Kaminsky\u2019s office.\n\u201cWe, as a community, are saying to you that you are making a gross error if, in fact, that [request for proposal] is going to be moving forward and is indeed tailored for [a sports arena for] the Islanders,\u201d Elmont resident Aubrey Phillips said.\n\u201cYou must choose between people that have flooded our auditorium in favor ofone hour of fun [and] juxtapose that with people that live here after that hour is finished. When that hour is finished, we the residents of Elmont and the greater community, have to clean it up and live with it,\u201d Phillips said.\nFloral Park resident Matthew Sexton suggested that Nassau County should get back to being a center of innovation.\nIt was a place for aerospace innovation as far back as the 1920s, according to the Nassau County Industrial Development Agency.\nThe assertion drew boos from Islander fans in attendance.\nNew York City has 2.2 million black people, according to a 2010 U.S. Census Bureau report. That is the most in any city across the country. Elmont has a population that is 45 percent black, according to a 2016 city data report.\nSexton cited the example of a tech incubator in Texas that will bring in a lot of money for that state.\n\u201cI don\u2019t want us to think big, I want us to think smart,\u201d Sexton said.\nThe nearly 60 speakers did agree there should be daily LIRR service to Belmont Park. The current rail is only operational for horse races from April to July.\nCould you paraphrase the position of Elmont resident Aubrey Phillips regarding the potential inclusion of a sports arena for the Islanders in the development plans?",

    "user_prompt": "Given the text: Dribbble. Maybe you love it; maybe you loathe it. Since its launch in 2009, it's become a popular way for designers to share peeks at what they're working on, or just promote their latest projects. Whether you think it's a good or bad thing for the design community, I wanted to share some of the aspects of the site that I've found useful, beyond just checking out others' work, stalking my favorite designers, and sharing my own work on occasion. You don't even need a coveted invite to take advantage of these Dribbble features.\nWhen you upload a shot, Dribbble automatically generates a color scheme from that shot. The results are often surprising. Dribbble picks up colors that aren't directly from the designer's exact color scheme. Or if the shot is a photo of a screen, or shows something like a table behind a printed design, it picks up those colors that are completely unrelated to the actual design. The result is unexpected color schemes that are often good starting points for branching out and creating your own surprising color schemes for a project.\nLet's say you don't have the freedom to completely create a color scheme from scratch. The client already has a brand color you're working with. If that color is one you never work with, you might not immediately know how to best use it, or what colors to pair with it. You can search Dribbble by color, down to the exact HEX number, making it easy to see what other designers have done with that color, and quickly getting an idea of what other colors work and don't work with it.\nWe've all spent a lot of time in Photoshop. A lot. Over the years we've developed our own methods and tricks for accomplishing what we want in it. Consequently, we've all developed our own blind spots in terms of some of Photoshop's features. One of the great things about working on a team with other designers at Viget is that I've often had a chance to work with another designer's PSD and learn how they use the program. A lot of designers on Dribbble attach PSDs with their shots, often as freebies for others who want to use their designs. I wouldn't suggest grabbing their UI designs and dragging them into your own comps. But if you see something you like and want to know how a designer achieved an aesthetic, it can be educational to crack open their PSD and find out what they did. Maybe they're using layer styles in ways you never thought of, or masks in a way you didn't know was possible.\nArticulating constructive criticism is difficult. The most useful critique to receive identifies the problem with a design, why it's a problem, and offers the designer inspiration for fixing it, without dictating exactly what you think the solution is. Critiquing like this is a skill and takes practice. Designers often post their work on Dribbble because they want feedback and critique. By giving critique on shots, you're helping them out, and you're keeping your own articulation and critical thinking skills sharp. These are good skills to have, not only when critiquing others, but when discussing design with clients.\nStudying processes over finished products has been a recurring theme with me this year. Because it is not a portfolio site, Dribbble is one of the best places to see the process designers go through, refining their work over time and incorporating feedback as a project progresses. Through projects and designers rebounding their own work, you can get an educational peek at what goes on behind the scenes that you probably won't see on a designer's polished portfolio piece.\nWhat about you? Have you found Dribbble useful beyond being a place to look at cool work and to have your own cool work looked at?\nWhat skill can be developed by giving constructive criticism on Dribbble, and how does it differ from critiquing finished portfolio pieces?",

One in 10 said they had had suicidal thoughts and 9% that they had self-harmed.\nDenise Hatton, the chief executive of YMCA England and Wales, said: \u201cBullying has always existed among young people, but this generation face increasing pressure to live up to unrealistic beauty ideals which they say come from celebrities, social media and the media.\nThe organisation spoke to 1,006 children aged 11 to 16 for the report. It found that for 54% of those who had experienced appearance-based bullying, it had started by the age of 10 and 51% said that friends were the culprits.\nDespite increasing concerns about cyberbullying, 72% experienced bullying about their appearance in person, compared with 26% online, and 80% in school.\nThe report acknowledges that social media adds a new dimension to bullying, but stresses that platforms such as Snapchat and WhatsApp are not the cause in themselves but \u201cmerely provide a vehicle through which young people are bullied\u201d.\nEighty-seven per cent of those who had experienced bullying suffered verbal abuse and 25% said they had been physically hurt. Sixty per cent said they had tried to change their appearance as a result.\nYMCA England and Wales urged schools to use its body confidence campaign toolkit, which contains resources designed to tackle body image anxiety in young people.",

    "user_prompt": "This is what I did for my second orange beef experiment. Hope you enjoy it.\n*If you cannot find low sodium chicken broth, you will have to dilute sauce mixture with water to taste. Probably anywhere from 2 tablespoons to 1/4 cup would suffice.\n** Peel orange and slice rind into strips between 1/4 and 1/2 inch long. Then slice strips crosswise like you would a loaf of bread. Final product should be thin and crescent shaped (hope I explained this clearly).\nAt least 5 to 6 hours before cooking beef, sprinkle it with salt and white pepper, making sure it is evenly mixed in meat. Next, sprinkle a couple of tablespoons of water over beef and mix it in. Follow this with the cornstarch and gently massage it evenly into meat. Lastly, mix in oil. I found that mixing in oil actually makes the meat very tender - even more than by just using cornstarch by itself (I now do this for both Chinese beef and pork dishes. Don't ask me why this is so. Set meat in refrigerator to marinate.\nAbout an hour before cooking beef, mix all ingredients in top column together EXCEPT dried red pepper pod, orange rind, sesame oil, cornstarch and hot oil. Set aside to allow flavors to marry. When ready to cook beef, heat wok and about 2 tablespoon oil. Toss in clove of minced garlic when oil is hot and saut\u00e9 for about 15 seconds before placing meat in wok. Cook meat for about 2 minutes being careful to not overcook it (doing so will make it tough). About halfway through the two minute cooking cycle, splash meat with about 1 tablespoon white wine or sherry. You should remove meat from wok just after all the red has disappeared. After you have removed meat and cleaned wok, reheat wok and about 1 tablespoon oil. After oil is hot, toss orange rind and red pepper pod in wok and saut\u00e9 very briefly being careful not to burn rind. After saut\u00e9 ing for about 15 seconds or so, add sauce. When edge of sauce starts to bubble, add cornstarch and water mixture. When sauce starts to thicken add hot oil and stir. Follow this with the beef and mix with sauce well. Lastly, turn off fire and drizzle sesame oil over beef mixture.\nMix briefly and serve over white rice.\nIf you want you can also add 1 to 2 tablespoons chopped green onions (green part only) to sauce mixture just before you add hot oil. I didn't do this, but some people do. This will impart a slightly different flavor. Also feel free to add extra red pepper pods if you like a hotter dish. You can also omit them altogether if you want. I only used one because my daughter does not like the extra heat.

This Center for Preventive Action Contingency Planning Memorandum by Brad W. Setser examines potential triggers and indicators of such a crisis and posits concrete policy options to limit U.S. vulnerability to the possibility of a plummeting dollar. It argues that the obvious long-term response to the risk of a dollar crisis is to limit buildup of the United States\u2019 external debt, and recommends that larger reserves\u2014and well-understood mechanisms for borrowing foreign exchange reserves from major foreign central banks\u2014would help to reduce the United States\u2019 vulnerability to such a crisis.\nThe Center for Preventive Action (CPA) Contingency Roundtable series seeks to organize focused discussions on plausible short to medium term contingencies that could seriously threaten U.S. interests.

The goal of the meeting series is not only to raise awareness among U.S. government officials and the expert community of potential crises but also to generate practical policy options to lessen the likelihood of the contingency and to reduce the negative consequences should it occur.

    "user_prompt": "Here is a piece of text: LAKE HELEN -- Some Lake Helen property owners and the City Commission have extra incentive to celebrate the new year.\nThe Lake Helen City Commission passed an amendment to its Comprehensive Plan this month that paves the way for residential construction on lots previously deemed too small.\nThe amendment, written in 2007 but not adopted until this month, allows owners of property smaller than one-third of an acre to build homes of less than the currently required 1,750 square feet in some residential areas. The amendment is expected to take effect in late January.\nCommissioner Rick Basso asked prior to passing the amendment whether it establishes a \"magic number\" of square feet that would be required for the so-called nonconforming lots.\nLake Helen City Administrator Don Findell said the city's planning and land use committee, as well as the City Commission, will use discretion to determine on a case-by-case basis the acceptable square footage for homes on nonconforming lots.\n\"We'll have some discretion over the actual size, and that will be based on the lot size and other requirements,\" Findell said.\nPrior to the change, the minimum square footage requirements combined with other rules like minimum setback, made it difficult to build on some smaller parcels in the city.\n\"The lots were simply too small to get a 1,750- or 1,850-square-foot structure on,\" Findell said. \"The desire was to create a mechanism by which those lots would become build-able in accordance with the comprehensive plan.\"\nThe amendment stems partly from feedback from residents, who approached the city after it completed revisions to the land-use portion of its comp plan in 2005. Their concerns gave rise to the amendment, which was proposed in 2007.\nBecause Lake Helen failed to meet certain statutory requirements set by the now-defunct Florida Department of Community Affairs, the proposed amendment was never adopted. That put Lake Helen's revision process on hold.\nIn April 2011, though, Gov. Rick Scott signed the Community Planning Act, legislation that lessens the state's involvement in the process of adopting comp plans changes. As a result, the state's responsibility in reviewing comprehensive plan amendments has been significantly reduced, Findell said.\n\"This (amendment) is one that fell into that open window we have because of the changes to DCA and the reviewing process,\" Mayor Buddy Snowden said.\nEssentially, the new act allows Lake Helen to continue to operate under its current comp plan even while the city is still working on meeting the statutory requirements, which have been simplified.\n\"The whole plan, including the newly adopted amendments, is a viable document now,\" said Findell of the city's comp plan.\nThe state's new approach could allow Lake Helen to complete the task of updating its long-range growth plans within the next 18 months.\n\"There's an entirely different comp plan evaluation and appraisal process now,\" Findell said, though the city still has to review its comp plan and determine whether any of the state's growth management legislation changes warrant changes to the comp plan, he added.\nUnder the new act, Lake Helen must submit a letter to the state by July 1. In the letter, the city must note whether legislation changes will necessitate Lake Helen making additional amendments to its comp plan. Lake Helen then has a year to prepare any required amendments.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: How has the Community Planning Act affected Lake Helen's ability to update its long-range growth plans?",

Middle schools will all start and stop at the same time.\nResearch has shown that students benefit from more sleep, but the natural sleep and wake cycles are later for older students and earlier for younger students. Adjusting the schedule will allow older students to start a little later in the day.\nThe changes are also expected to make the district transportation system more efficient.\nCan you summarize the changes made to bell schedules at all schools and their expected benefits?",

    "user_prompt": "How has the U.K. version of X-Factor leveraged social media to engage audiences, and what insights can be drawn from this experience for the U.S. version?: Voting on the social networking site would be reserved for final rounds.\nFox, Simon Cowell and producers of The X-Factor are in talks with Facebook to bring online voting to the upcoming U.S. version of the singing competition, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.\nAccording to plans currently being negotiated, voting via Facebook would be reserved for the final rounds of the show, scheduled to launch in the U.S. on Fox this fall, and it would happen alongside a traditional phone voting system. Details and security issues are still being worked out, and an insider cautions that a deal could fall apart or the system might not be worked out in time for the show\u2019s first season. But the plan is for viewers to be able to vote for contestants via their own Facebook page or an X-Factor application. The roll-out would be part of an innovative global partnership with Facebook that would include all versions of X-Factor around the world.\nFacebook voting would immediately distinguish X-Factor from its U.S. competitors and from American Idol, which Cowell left last year after nine seasons. Facebook, with 550 million users worldwide, also is by far the largest social networking website in the U.S, giving X-Factor a huge promotional platform and an opportunity for fans to engage with the show via a service most already use. Facebook would also benefit from a partnership with X-Factor, which will arrive in September amid massive hype due to Cowell\u2019s fame from Idol and his huge success with X-Factor in the UK.\nHowever, a deal with Facebook instead of longtime rival MySpace\u2014which, like Fox, is owned by News Corp.\u2014would be sure to ruffle feathers inside the company. Idol, for instance, this season allowed potential contestants to submit videos of themselves via MySpace. While the show\u2019s producer Nigel Lythgoe told an Atlanta newspaper that Idol will soon add online voting, nothing has been announced (UPDATE: EW reports Facebook voting could be added to Idol as soon as next week). Reps for Fox, Facebook, Cowell and his Syco Television declined to comment.\nCowell is said to be a major force behind the move to online voting. The reality mogul, who will star in and executive produce the U.S. X-Factor with FremantleMedia North America and Fox, is said to covet an audience as similarly youthful as the show enjoys in the U.K., where it delivers far more younger viewers than any other unscripted show (some estimates in the U.K. say that 60 percent of X-Factor\u2019s audience is aged 15-34).\nThe U.K. X-Factor has already leveraged social media to boost audience engagement. Contestants often communicate directly with fans via Facebook and Twitter and viewers sometimes generate 500 tweets a second when the show is airing.",

    "user_prompt": "I spotted a notice pinned to the board at the entrance to Witham Way Country Park which invited people to join a free wood carving group. Free is excellent as far as I am concerned and I made a note of the date. At the allotted time Peter Tree, the professional chair maker and carver, supplied us with a piece of pallet wood and a range of gouges supplied by Transported, who were the instigators and funders of our venture. After a short demonstration we were asked who wanted to have a go and we were off; that simple pallet wood was transformed into oak leaves and fish, and we were hooked. After the initiation we were let loose on a piece of oak and carved alongside each other for a number of months creating the pieces that can be viewed as you walk along to the river. We learned a lot about carving and about each other, and although we were a diverse bunch of individuals, friendships grew. Transported were a wonderful support to us throughout this time and we were nurtured as the group developed. We enjoyed free use of tools and wood and advice, until the day came when the apron strings were partially severed. We were to learn to walk unaided and as toddlers we floundered for a while before we began to find our feet. The winter months were challenging and we needed to keep moving or freeze to the spot. At this juncture Transported found us indoor space to carve, but the first venue did not work out and we felt isolated as we rarely met anyone else. After knocking on a number of doors asking for a room we were invited to work in St Botolph\u2019s Church, our very own Boston Stump. It has proved to be an amazing place in which to carve our wood. Words are inadequate to describe the sense of history and belonging or the peace and calm to be found within those ancient walls, even the almost imperceptible echo made by craftsman\u2019s tools over the aeons. We enjoy meeting people from all over the world. We share expertise and wood and fruit and vegetables (one French group swapped a plant for a mouse) and jam and memories and ideas and companionship, and we even have the occasional disagreement. But we are proud to be called the Boston and South Holland Wood Carvers (B&SHWC). Our big project has been bubbling for over a year now, it is the \u2018Tribute to the Local Fishermen\u2019. The idea has developed steadily and we have been gifted by the Wayneflete Charitable Trust and Boston Big Local Community Chest. This provided enough funds to purchase essential gouges and oak. The oak will need to be cut and aired before we can start carving, but hopefully not too long before we can bring it into The Stump and set to work \u2013 apparently the 10 pieces of oak which will be assembled to make the 5 panels will weigh in the region of \u00be of a ton. We still have a long way to go and will need to find more funds to complete the base and finish the Tribute as we have envisaged. In the meantime, we are carving little mice, turning boxes and making other wooden items for sale, and at the end of the year, from the donations we receive, plan to tithe the Stump to say a small thank you for such wonderful hospitality. Can you summarize the story of the Boston and South Holland Wood Carvers and their current project to create a Tribute to Local Fishermen?",

    "user_prompt": "Regulation of innate CD8 memory T cells during Salmonella typhimurium infection.\nThe pathogenesis of HIV infection, and in particular the development of immunodeficiency, remains incompletely understood. During HIV infection both innate and adaptive immune responses are raised, but they appear to be insufficient or too late to eliminate the virus. Whereas much knowledge exists on the role of adaptive immunity during HIV infection, it has only recently been appreciated that the innate immune response may also play an important part in HIV pathogenesis.\nOne can easily assume that the constant production of viral RNAs and proteins in a chronic lentiviral infection has the potential to stimulate innate immunity response and likely to over-activate the whole immune system eventually resulting in AIDS. Retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I), melanoma differentiation factor 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) are pattern recognition receptors that play a pivotal role in sensing nucleic acids from pathogens in the cytoplasm of infected cells and in inducing type-I interferon (IFN). Several studies suggested that RIG-I and MDA5 could detect lentiviral RNA, but currently there are no direct evidences of RIG-I or MDA5 interaction with viral RNA in HIV-infected cells and the sequences of HIV nucleic acids that are involved in these interactions are unknown.\nToday new DNA sequencing technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, open a possibility of high-throughput sequencing of RNAs at low cost with no need to design specific primers. We have recently developed and validated a new protocol to characterize, in an infectious context, the nucleic acids bound to a viral protein by using a combination of virus reverse genetics, affinity purification and next-generation sequencing. In this project we wish to take advantage of this protocol to perform high-throughput identification of HIV RNA ligands for RIG-I, MDA5 or LGP2 cytoplasmic sensors.

    "user_prompt": "Richard Lewis\u2019s stark, striking Self Portrait in White Shirt (2004) establishes at a glance the mode of bold, arresting portraiture he has practiced over the last decade and a half. Here, his own half-length, life-size visage dominates a shallow space wherein he reveals himself at a terse, decisive moment. Though a stretched canvas at right appears primed for action, he stands stock still, his flushed face charged with emotion. In particular, the emphatic swabs of thick red and white pigment slashing across his forehead augur a deep-seated determination. Another angsty portrayal of 2004 represents Anthony, a friend whose parted lips and wary glance imply concern and vulnerability in equal measure.\nPainted about a year and a half after a six year sojourn in New York (1996-2002), these bare-knuckled portrait suggest Lewis\u2019s affirmative resolve to re-engage with his art and natal environs. In fact, his 2002 reappearance was his second repatriation to his Detroit roots; earlier, after graduation from Yale in 1993, he had relocated to his hometown but stayed only a year and a half before decamping for his six year residency in Gotham.\nNotable as well is a raft of ambitious double portraits that caught the attention of critics during his multi-year New York residency. In James and Kelly (1996), two men, seated side by side, face forward and avert eye contact. Yet their gazes in opposite directions intersect and James on the right grasps the arm of his lover\u2019s chair, if not his lover\u2019s arm. A masked person at the rear, preoccupied and wearing a respirator, constructs a sculpture. In another dual depiction, Study Group (1997), Lewis presents himself and a studious friend, the former facing forward, fists clenched, and the latter in profile, opposites ostensibly \u201cstudying.\u201d A large, red-figured carpet backdrops and visually augments the seated Lewis (a decorative device that also enlivens James and Kelly), while the rapt reader is set against a green, hilly cityscape. But what are they studying? Revolution perhaps, given the gasoline can and books by James Baldwin and Malcolm X scattered on the floor. A third example, Nelson (1996), the largest at 84 x 48,\u201d is daringly surprising in that the towering Nelson, front and center, overshadows the second figure partially visible behind him, almost as if the portrayal represents a dueling couple\u2014as a John Coltrane poster looms behind.\nCloser to home\u2014to both Motown and family\u2014are two affecting double portraits of Lewis\u2019s sisters. Painted more than a decade apart, each conveys the pair\u2019s closeness and separateness. In the 1998 depiction, Kim and Tonya Watching T.V. are scrunched together on a loveseat directing their full attention on the television set in the foreground. Tonya, on the right, turns slightly away from her sibling as well as from whatever is transpiring on the screen; her sidelong glance, as well as her sib\u2019s bland expression, suggests their less than enthralled interest in the unfolding program. Yet the soft, muted palette contributes a measure of intimacy to the scene.

    "user_prompt": "The story of Whatsapp began when Brian Acton and Jan Koum, both former Yahoo employees, left the company together to take a much-needed break from work in 2007. The story of Whatsapp is a live example of innovation in technology and simplicity over the years. In the current times, anyone who owns a smartphone has access to Whatsapp, and more often than not uses it to communicate with friends and family members.\nThe idea of Whatsapp came to Jan Koum after purchasing an iPhone when he realized that a whole new list of applications was going to be launched soon. After this, Jan started visiting his friend Alex Fishman, and they began sketching out details for the application. Jan selected the name \u201cWhatsApp\u201d over all others because it almost sounded like \u201cwhat\u2019s up.\u201d Jan Koum\u2019s first idea for WhatsApp was to build an application where people could value personal value without asking for it. WhatsApp is thus an application that doesn\u2019t ask users for any personal information to use WhatsApp. He wanted the application to be simple, easy to use by anyone, and yet personal.\nThe first WhatsApp application was developed for iPhones only. The first application was made such that users could see each other\u2019s statuses. Later, Jon updated it so that every time a user changed their status; all the users on their network would be informed. This version of WhatsApp got a lot of users, which is when Acton pulled another set of his friends to invest in the company. Even though initially WhatsApp was launched only for iPhones, versions for BlackBerry and Android soon came up. WhatsApp saw a very big growth of users, even though it wasn\u2019t spending a dime on marketing. This was when WhatsApp was changed from a free to a paid service, wherein the iPhone users need to purchase it once, while other users need to purchase it at a very minimal cost every 12 months. This was done because a verification text was sent to users on installing WhatsApp, and that needed funding. Jon and Acton didn\u2019t want WhatsApp to grow too fast, in the off chance that the server crashes.\nLaunched in late July 2009, by August 2014, WhatsApp\u2019s user base has swollen to a whopping 600 million active users, with India being the most active user. WhatsApp changed from simply being a messaging app, and reading statuses, to an application that could also allow sharing of videos and pictures among users. This lead to even more downloads of the app, with more than 25 million users being added every month.\nWhatsApp had a 1.5 billion dollar calculation, but it was shocking to see Facebook acquire it for a whopping 19 billion USDs. This has been the largest acquisition by Facebook to date, and ended up making the 50 or so employees and WhatsApp stockholders incredibly rich almost overnight. A few months after being sold to Facebook, Jon announced that a new calling feature would be added to WhatsApp wherein the users could call each other using this facility. Thus, Whatsapp has been expanding every day with around 800 million active users now, and expanding. More than 30 billion text messages are sent every day using this application. Based on the passage above, Continuation: Discuss the challenges that WhatsApp faces in terms of privacy and security, and how the company is addressing them.",

    "user_prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What is the Flyers' current standing in the Eastern Conference and how many games do they have left in the season?\n\nPassage: PHILADELPHIA (AP) The Philadelphia Flyers have transformed from the worst team in the NHL to not-so-bad in the East.\nTheir recent run toward respectability could net them the playoff berth that seemed inconceivable before the All-Star break.\nOskar Lindblom, Michael Raffl and Scott Laughton scored in the second period, and hard-charging Philadelphia beat the Ottawa Senators 3-2 on Monday night to inch closer to a wild-card spot.\n\"It's been realistic for us for a while,\" Flyers center Nolan Patrick said. \"Everyone believes. That's our goal and that's what we're pushing toward.\"\nThe Flyers were 16-23-6 on Jan. 12 and even the faithful fans had all but lost hope for a playoff appearance, thinking their favorite team was about to play out the string under new general manager Chuck Fletcher and interim coach Scott Gordon.\nLed by rookie goalie Carter Hart, the Flyers reeled off an eight-game winning streak over late January-February to climb out of the NHL cellar and have now won four of five games to move toward the eighth seed.\nColumbus, which sits in eighth in the East, lost 2-0 to the New York Islanders on Monday and Montreal was idle. Both teams have 79 points, but Columbus holds the tiebreaker.\nThe Flyers have 76 points with 13 games remaining and what once was a lost season instead has the team thinking playoffs.\n\"It's getting closer and closer, for sure,\" defenseman Radko Gudas said. \"We can't be looking at the big picture, right now. It's been working for us looking at the game ahead.\"\nPlaying the NHL-worst Senators certainly helped.\nChris Tierney beat Brian Elliott, subbing for the injured Hart, for his eighth goal of the season in the first period in front of a listless crowd.\nBut the Flyers perked up in the second and ripped off three goals against Craig Anderson in a scoring frenzy that had Gritty dancing. The Flyers tied it on a bit of a pinball play - Shayne Gostisbehere fired a slapper off Sean Couturier's knee and the puck pinged off Lindblom's skate for the quirky goal.\nRaffl tipped in his sixth goal of the season for a 2-1 lead in his 400th career NHL game, and Laughton followed with his 11th late in the period.\n\"We'll see where we end up,\" Raffl said. \"It's a little bit too much if you look at the big picture.\"\nThe Flyers are 6-1-1 over their last eight and are as close to a wild-card spot as they've been since November, before they fired general manager Ron Hextall and coach Dave Hakstol.\nFlyers fans finally started a \"Let's go Flyers!\" chant in the waning minutes and they cheered when the Blue Jackets' score flashed on the big screen.\nFilip Chlapik scored his first goal of the season with 3 minutes left but it was too late for the Senators in their fourth straight loss.\n\"You can't come down to the end and hope to get two against a good team,\" Tierney said.\nThe Flyers held on and meaningful games in April suddenly seem on the horizon.\n\"We're a pretty confident group, right now,\" Raffl said. \"We're just finding ways to win games.\"\nNOTES: Laughton has points in five straight games. ... Both teams have new coaches since their last meeting in November (Hakstol-Gordon for the Flyers; Guy Boucher-Marc Crawford for the Senators). ... Flyers F Jakub Voracek served the first of a two-game suspension for interference against New York Islanders defenseman Johnny Boychuk.\nSenators: host St. Louis on Thursday.\nFlyers: Host the Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals on Thursday.",

    "user_prompt": "I\u2019m going to be completely honest with you, because I think we\u2019re cool like that. You take time out of your day to come on over and spend some time with me, so it\u2019s only fair I\u2019m open with you\u2026 right? Here\u2019s the deal. Originally this was going to be a burrito post. But for the life of me I could not get a good photo of all the different components wrapped up in the tortilla. It didn\u2019t look appetizing at all! Ah the woes of food photography. And really, I don\u2019t know why I was so fixated on making this a burrito anyway. Asheley always prefers hers as a burrito bowl. And I\u2019m totally happy with a bowl as well.. as long as I still have a tortilla or some tortilla chips nearby so I can scoop up some of the goodness and eat it that way. What can I say? I\u2019m tortilla dependent. What I love about burrito bowls is that they are pretty darn flexible depending upon how much time you have to whip up dinner. When I have the whole day to hang around the house and cook, I\u2019ll take the time to make Cowboy Beans and Cilantro Lime Brown Rice. I\u2019ll slowly braise pork shoulder for mouth-watering, irresistible carnitas. But let\u2019s get real. Sometimes you just have to get dinner on the table. You can easily cut some corners to make this a quick weeknight meal. Store-bought salsa. Crack open a can of beans and heat. Some quick-cooking rice. And maybe throw some chicken or steak on the grill. Heck, even one of those rotisserie chickens you see cooking away in the supermarket could do the trick. There is, though, one thing that Asheley will never skip on: guacamole. If it\u2019s burrito bowl night and there\u2019s no guacamole, you know there\u2019s gonna be problems. Burrito bowls are also a great way to stretch out meals. You don\u2019t need a big quantity of any one thing, so there\u2019s almost always leftovers for a quick meal the following night (and even the night after that). And listen, no worries if you don\u2019t have queso fresco lying around. I personally like it for it\u2019s salty kick, but Asheley prefers a big mountain of shredded cheddar or monterey jack on her burrito bowl. And a mountain might be an understatement. She has a thing for cheese. In bowls, layer cilantro lime brown rice, cowboy beans, and carnitas on top of one another. Top with pico de gallo and guacamole. Garnish with queso fresco (or any of your favorite cheese), cilantro, and a wedge of lime. Who needs burritos when you have a bowl like this? That\u2019s a beautiful looking meal, and definitely full of lots of fresh and healthy flavours! I\u2019m all into this one! Great recipe! I love the bowl too\u2026 but I\u2019m pretty addicted to tortillas so I still like to have one nearby \ud83d\ude42 I rip off a piece of the tortilla and scoop up some of the burrito bowl goodness. Based on the passage above, What is one thing that Asheley will never skip on when preparing burrito bowls?",

    "user_prompt": "Can you suggest a vegetarian entree recipe that uses preserved lemons?\nGenerate according to: Once you've sampled preserved lemons, you'll understand why they've become such a popular and essential ingredient in Moroccan cooking. Here's a list of recipes which call for this tangy, salty, and delightful addition.\nIf you're planning to make your own preserved lemons, be aware that they need a full month to cure before they're ready to use in cooking and salads.\nChicken with preserved lemon and olives is perhaps the most popular of Moroccan dishes which use preserved lemons. Along with saffron and ginger, they provide key flavor to this and other tagines.\nSurprisingly easy to make, lamb with preserved lemon and olives may be prepared with lamb, beef, or \u200bgoat meat. The recipe explains procedures for using a conventional pot or pressure cooker but also links to the preparation method when using a clay or ceramic tagine.\nUse fresh or preserved lemon in this traditional fish and veggie tagine. A Moroccan marinade called chermoula adds plenty of flavors, but you can make things a bit fiery by adding cayenne or chili pepper.\nMoroccan spices and preserved lemon transform a head of cauliflower into an exciting side dish full of flavor and color. You might also consider offering it as a light vegetarian entree.\nArtichoke hearts and bottoms are a favorite vegetable while in season during winter months. For this Moroccan artichoke salad, they're simmered in a tangy sauce with Moroccan spices, garlic, and preserved lemon. Olives add color and flavor.\nMallow is a plentiful green in Morocco, but if it's not available in your area you can make this mallow salad with spinach or a mix of greens. This cooked salad boasts incredible flavor. Seasoned with olive oil, garlic, herbs and spices, it should be offered as a dip with wedges of Moroccan bread.\nRoasted pepper and tomato salad is a popular offering in homes, restaurants and roadside grills. It can be eaten as a dip or used as a sandwich filler along with meats. This version includes a little bit of minced preserved lemon rind for extra flavor.\nZesty seasoning and tangy preserved lemons contrast perfectly with the natural sweetness of carrots in this beef or lamb tagine. If you like things fiery, offer a little harissa on the side.\nCabbage may not make it onto your shopping list most weeks, but do give this dish of lamb with cabbage a try. It's a surprisingly delicious way to prepare this vitamin-C abundant vegetable.\nAlthough many Americans have never tried cardoons, in Morocco they're quite popular, particularly when prepared in this classic tagine recipe with preserved lemons and olives. You may find them at a farmers market if you don't grow them yourself. Cardoon stalks look like giant celery and if you are unfamiliar with them, you will need to know how to clean cardoons to prep them for cooking.\nEnjoy this tangia marrakchia, often called bachelor's stew. Although you'll sometimes find tangia recipes calling for a conventional pot or pressure cooker, the traditional way to prepare this stewed meat dish is to slow-cook it in an urn-like clay pot called a tangia. If you don't own a tangia, you can use a casserole or other oven-safe dish instead.\nThe addition of preserved lemon is optional but recommended in this chicken dish with nigella seeds. The seeds impart oregano-like flavor and have the added benefit of being very healthy for you.\nThis delicious chicken with potatoes and olives has been a family favorite for many years. Preserved lemon is optional for those who like its tangy, lemony flavor.\nThis tagine with carrots, potatoes, and chickpeas is another veggie-laden tagine that calls for preserved lemons and olives for extra flavor. Use lamb, beef, or goat meat. If using dried chickpeas as most Moroccans do, remember to soak them the night before.\nThis tagine with eggplant is another tagine where preserved lemons are optional but recommended. Meat is stewed with onions, tomatoes, and partially-pared eggplant. The traditional Moroccan seasoning includes ginger, saffron, turmeric, cinnamon, and pepper.\nPotatoes are a common addition to this classic tagine of lamb and green beans. Beef or goat meat may, of course, be substituted for the lamb.\nThis delicious family meal of lamb or beef with potatoes features kid-friendly potatoes stewed with lamb or beef until tender. Robustly seasoned with Moroccan spices, the sauce is given unique lemony flavor by the addition of preserved lemons.\nFragrant, delicious and easy to throw together, this chicken tagine gets baked in the oven rather than being prepared stove top. For casual meals, patates frites are often served right on top!",

    "user_prompt": "Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material\n\nQuestion/Instruction: How does the GovSat 1 project merge secure, encrypted telecom capabilities of government-owned military communications satellites with a commercial business model?\n\nGiven material: Lifting off from Cape Canaveral on the 60th anniversary of the launch of Explorer 1, the first U.S. satellite, the commercial booster rumbled into a clear late afternoon sky a day after SpaceX scrubbed a countdown to replace a sensor on the Falcon 9\u2019s second stage.\nThe 229-foot-tall (70-meter) Falcon 9 rocket fired nine Merlin 1D main engines and climbed away from Cape Canaveral\u2019s Complex 40 launch pad at 4:25 p.m. EST (2125 GMT), launching a few miles from the site of Explorer 1\u2019s historic blastoff from the Complex 26 launch facility on Jan. 31, 1958.\nThe Falcon 9\u2019s engines gimbaled to steer the rocket on a trajectory east from Florida\u2019s Space Coast, and the rocket\u2019s first stage booster \u2014 reused after a launch in May 2017 \u2014 shut down and detached for a descent into the Atlantic Ocean.\nAbout a minute later, the composite shroud that protected Luxembourg\u2019s GovSat 1 communications satellite during the initial stages of liftoff jettisoned, shedding weight for the Falcon 9\u2019s upper stage powering into orbit.\nThe Falcon 9 rocket\u2019s booster stage made a controlled splashdown at sea a few hundred miles east of Cape Canaveral, testing the effectiveness of a high-thrust landing burn using three of its engines, instead of the usual one.\nAs expected, SpaceX\u2019s drone ship was not in position to recover the first stage as it normally does, but the Falcon 9 booster on the GovSat 1 mission was fitted with landing legs and grid fins, hardware necessary for a controlled descent.\nElon Musk wrote on Twitter that the recovery team will try to tow the first stage back to port.\nMeanwhile, the upper stage\u2019s single Merlin engine shut down around eight-and-a-half minutes into the mission after reaching an initial parking orbit. The kerosene-fueled engine reignited about 18 minutes later for a roughly minute-long firing, aiming to place GovSat in an elliptical, high-altitude \u201csupersynchronous\u201d transfer orbit stretching as high as 36,000 miles (58,000 kilometers) above Earth at its highest point.\nThe Falcon 9\u2019s upper stage deployed the 9,325-pound (4,230-kilogram) GovSat 1 spacecraft, also known as SES 16, around 32 minutes after liftoff.\nOwned by GovSat, a public-private joint venture between SES and the government of Luxembourg, the new satellite will offer secure, military communications services for Luxembourg authorities and the country\u2019s allies in Europe and NATO.\nSES declared the mission a success in a post-launch press release.\nGovSat 1\u2019s on-board thruster will reshape the satellite\u2019s orbit to reach a circular path around Earth\u2019s equator. Several orbital adjustment maneuvers are planned in the coming weeks, and GovSat 1 should reach its perch in geostationary orbit at an altitude of nearly 22,300 miles (35,800 kilometers) by mid-February.\nIn a briefing with reporters before the launch, Biewer said GovSat 1 should be operational by the beginning of March, once the satellite reaches its final orbit and completes activation and testing procedures.\nThe satellite project was financed with 100 million euros ($123 million) invested in a 50-50 shareholder arrangement between SES and the Luxembourg government, plus a 125 million euro ($154 million) loan from a consortium of Luxembourg banks.\nThe startup investments and loan covered GovSat\u2019s founding costs, and the procurement of the GovSat 1 spacecraft and its launch on a Falcon 9 rocket.\nBuilt by Orbital ATK, GovSat 1 carries Ka-band and X-band telecom equipment to relay data, radio signals and other communications across a zone stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Indian Ocean. Parked in geostationary orbit at 21.5 degree east longitude, GovSat 1 will move around Earth in lock-step with the planet\u2019s rotation, giving it a fixed geographic coverage range.\nGovSat 1 will provide military units deployed by Luxembourg\u2019s European and NATO allies secure communications links via fixed land positions or antennas on ships in the Mediterranean Sea, the Baltic Sea, and the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.\nGovSat 1 merges the secure, encrypted telecom capabilities of traditional government-owned military communications satellites with a commercial business model, resulting in cost savings.\n\u201cIn X-band, we are featuring a so-called global beam, probably the highest power that is available on the market today, and this is very well suited for providing support for maritime and land-based operations,\u201d Biewer said. \u201cIt will also be featuring five steerable X-band mission means that provide high-power support for mobility applications in this very resilient frequency.\nGovSat 1 is not hardened against a nuclear attack, like some government-owned relay satellites, but engineers built the satellite to be resilient to jamming and other threats.\nGovSat 1 will support military operations, civilian security forces, emergency responders and border forces, including patrols in the Mediterranean Sea, a region trafficked by migrants from the Middle East and North Africa.\nA contingent of dignitaries from Luxembourg traveled to Cape Canaveral for GovSat 1\u2019s launch, including Bettel and Etienne Schneider, Luxembourg\u2019s deputy prime minister. Luxembourg\u2019s Heriditary Grand Duke Guillaume and his wife the Heriditary Grand Duchesse Stephanie were also present for the launch.\nFor SES, GovSat 1 is an opportunity to expand the company\u2019s reach into the international government services market. SES already has a unit based near Washington, D.C., to oversee the company\u2019s business with the U.S. government, but its role is restricted outside the United States, according to Karim Michel Sabbagh, CEO of SES.\nSabbagh said GovSat 1 will help SES\u2019s ongoing support to help respond to natural disasters, providing telecom services in the aftermath of earthquakes and hurricanes. Humanitarian and peacekeeping missions in Africa could also be aided by GovSat 1.\nSpaceX will follow Wednesday\u2019s launch with the long-delayed debut flight of the Falcon Heavy rocket as soon as Tuesday, Feb. 6, from launch pad 39A at NASA\u2019s Kennedy Space Center.\nThe triple-core rocket, made of three Falcon 9 booster stages bolted together, has a three-hour launch window Tuesday opening at 1:30 p.m. EST (1830 GMT).\nOnce SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy clears the pad, two more Falcon 9 missions are on track for liftoffs in February with Spanish-owned satellites.\nOne Falcon 9 rocket will lift off Feb. 17 from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California with the Spanish Paz Earth observation satellite, followed by a Falcon 9 launch from Cape Canaveral around Feb. 22 with Hispasat 30W-6, a multipurpose telecom craft.\nWednesday\u2019s launch came 60 years after the first U.S. satellite, Explorer 1, rocketed into orbit from Cape Canaveral aboard a Juno 1 launcher designed by Wernher von Braun and his team of German and U.S. scientists at Redstone Arsenal, Alabama.\nNASA and U.S. Air Force officials, together with surviving members of the original Explorer 1 launch team, gathered at Cape Canaveral\u2019s Complex 26 launch pad Wednesday to celebrate the occasion and unveil a new historical marker.\nDesigned and built at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the Explorer 1 satellite detected the existence of the Van Allen radiation belts, named for Explorer 1 scientist James Van Allen.\nExplorer 1 was the third human-made satellite sent into orbit, launching after the Soviet Union\u2019s Sputnik 1 and Sputnik 2 spacecraft blasted off in late 1957.\nAn attempt to place a small satellite in orbit with a U.S. Navy Vanguard rocket in December 1957 failed in spectacular fashion, ending with an explosion on the launch pad.\n\u201cWe may have gotten off to a bit of a fiery start in the beginning, but here we are now leading the world, and we launch again today,\u201d said Brig. Gen. Wayne Monteith, commander of the U.S. Air Force\u2019s 45th Space Wing, in remarks Wednesday shortly before the launch of GovSat 1. \u201cWith the successful launch of the SpaceX Falcon 9 GovSat mission \u2026 we will have launched 3,568 rockets from the Eastern Range, not at all bad considering how we began.",

    "user_prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Why did SpaceX delay the planned launch attempt from Friday to Monday?\n\nPassage: Launch of a Falcon 9 rocket and the SES-12 satellite is now targeted for Monday morning, pending tests on the rocket's upper stage.\nBy firing its upper stage engine for a few extra seconds, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is expected to add up to seven years of life to a communications satellite targeting launch early Monday from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\n\u201cIt gives us that last little bit of fuel, that last little push,\u201d Martin Halliwell, chief technology officer of Luxembourg-based satellite operator SES, told reporters Thursday at Port Canaveral\u2019s Exploration Tower.\nEarlier Thursday, SpaceX announced it had delayed a planned Friday morning launch attempt to Monday to perform more tests on the rocket\u2019s upper stage.\nA Monday liftoff will be planned as early 12:29 a.m., but could occur as late as 4:29 a.m. if the launch team wants to wait for better weather.\nThe forecast looks favorable, with a 70 percent chance of conditions meeting launch rules, according to the Air Force\u2019s 45th Weather Squadron.\nThe rocket\u2019s first-stage booster is flying for a second time, after launching an Air Force mission last September. SpaceX will not try to land the booster again.\n\"We\u2019ve actually stripped everything off the first stage, there are no landing legs on board, so this is going straight to the ocean,\" said Halliwell.\nThe upper stage is a new model incorporating performance upgrades that SpaceX refers to as \u201cBlock 5,\" which flew for the first time May 11.\nThe stage\u2019s Merlin engine will fire twice to place the SES-12 satellite in an egg-shaped orbit. Extending the second burn's duration just slightly will stretch the orbit's high point, or apogee, up to about 36,000 feet.\nFrom that high point, the satellite won\u2019t need to use as much of its own fuel to maneuver into a final orbit 22,300 miles over the equator, flattening out the 27-degree inclination the spacecraft launched into from Cape Canaveral.\n\u201cThe higher we go, the less energy we require to bring the inclination back to the equator,\u201d Halliwell explained.\nThe nearly 12,000-pound SES-12 satellite built by Airbus Defense and Space is designed to last at least 15 years. Satellites often exceed their design lives, but Halliwell said just the fuel savings from the Falcon 9 rocket engine's seconds-longer burn could extend the life of SES-12 to 22 years.",

    "user_prompt": "My mother-in-law is the sweetest, most generous little Chinese woman you would ever want to meet. She\u2019s also got a green thumb. She\u2019s one of those folks that can buy any old tomato at the grocery store, eat half, stick one of the seeds in a jar of dirt on her window sill, and have beautiful, lush tomatoes for the rest of the summer. Needless to say, she is also a great cook. Not only does she craft wonderful traditional Chinese food in her kitchen, but she makes a mean lasagna, too! I\u2019m always a little intimidated when attempting one of her tried and true recipes in my own kitchen, but she has been kind enough to tutor me through the process of several of her old standbys, which also happen to be my hubberman\u2019s favorites. Yesterday, I finally tackled her gyoza recipe for the first time. Yes, it only took me, like, 5 YEARS from when she taught me the process to muster up the courage to try it myself. Here\u2019s the recipe. Warning \u2013 this is one of those \u201cpinch of this,\u201d \u201cbit of that\u201d recipes that allows you a little bit of latitude with the ingredients. Just go with it, it\u2019s worth it! 1. In a mixer or by hand, thoroughly mix pork with the onions, parsley and cabbage. You will want to make sure your cabbage and parsley are completely dry prior to mixing so your mixture doesn\u2019t get too loose or moist. Add about three pinches of salt and a few generous grinds of black pepper. 2. Make a thick mixture of flour and water. The consistency should be like Elmer\u2019s glue, and smooth, not lumpy. 3. Take your wrapper and place a small amount of your flour \u201cglue\u201d around the edge of 1/2 of the wrapper. 4. Place a heaping tsp. of your pork mixture in the center of the wrapper. Don\u2019t put too much or it will tear the wrapper. 6. Continue this process with all your wrappers, keeping the gyoza that are ready under a wet paper towel to prevent them from drying out. When you near the end of your pork supply, place a large pot of water on to boil. 7. Add your gyoza in small batches to your boiling water (I found that 7 at a time worked best) and boil according to your wrappers\u2019 instructions. Mine said 5 minutes and that seemed perfect. You don\u2019t want to overcook, or the wrapper will fall apart. 8. While your first batch is boiling, heat 3 tbsp (I ended up using more than this) of oil in a large frying pan. Once 5 minutes has past, carefully transfer your gyoza one by one from the pot to the pan using a strainer spoon so you don\u2019t get oil/water splatter. Ouch. 9. Fry your gyoza until they are lightly browned and crispy. I found it helped to move them around gently in the pan, lest they live up to their \u201cpot sticker\u201d nickname! Don\u2019t overcrowd your pan, or they will also stick to each other. While you are frying your first batch, you can start your second batch in the water, and so on until you have worked through them all. For your dipping sauce, you can use a store bought sauce, or simply dip them in soy sauce and call it a day. We like to combine soy sauce, vinegar, hot sauce and sesame oil to taste and dip them in that. Yummo! And in case you don\u2019t believe my delay in preparing these little guys, here\u2019s a scrapbook page I made from our gyoza tutoring session, back in 2007! Glad I finally worked up the nerve to tackle these little pot stickers! What is the dipping sauce recommended for gyoza?",

    "user_prompt": "Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material\n\nQuestion/Instruction: What specific challenge did you face in choreographing the Enchantment Under the Sea dance sequence in Back to the Future, and how did you approach it?\n\nGiven material: What was it like to choreograph the Back to the Future movies?\nMichael J. Fox in Back to the Future.\nFirst of all, not everyone involved with Back to the Future was able to work on the second and third films. Due to the nature of the film industry, where one goes from project to project, some people were unable to work on all three films. I was lucky enough to be able to participate in all three, and all of us received black leather bomber jackets with the logo and additional stripes to indicate if you had worked on all three.\nI was hired to work on the film in the fall of 1984, and it was my first film as choreographer. I had only assisted other choreographers on films, and I had just completed working as an assistant choreographer on the ill-fated A Chorus Line. I was aware at the time that it was going to be less than stellar, in spite of the director Sir Richard Attenborough, who had won the Best Director Oscar the previous year for Gandhi.\nNevertheless, when I returned to Los Angeles, I was called to interview for a new movie to be produced by Steven Spielberg\u2019s production company, Amblin, and directed by Robert Zemeckis. I showed up for the interview at Universal Studios, where Amblin was located, and was interviewed by producer Neil Canton. All I was told was that there was a character in the film who at one point is back in time and plays a guitar solo in which he basically demonstrates elements of all the classic rock \u2019n\u2019 roll guitar moves from Pete Townsend to Chuck Berry \u2026 in front of an audience of teenagers who have not heard rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, as it has yet to be invented or performed in their time. It sounded like something I could easily feel comfortable with, as I had spent part of the year before touring with Stevie Nicks and watching guitar legend Waddy Wachtel onstage every night. I was excited to get the call shortly afterward that I had been hired.\nAs soon as the script arrived, I sat down and read it in one sitting. I had read scripts of movies I had worked on before, and I knew this one was something exceptional. It was the first script I had ever read that you just knew was a great movie. It didn\u2019t require any changes or additions\u2014it read exactly like the finished movie. It is still, to this day, the only script that I\u2019ve ever read that was already a great movie just needing to be shot.\nBack to the Future at first glance doesn\u2019t seem to need a choreographer. I was hired to choreograph the Enchantment Under the Sea\u2013themed dance that takes place near the end of the movie. The gym was to be filled with high school students dancing to the pre\u2013rock \u2019n\u2019 roll music at first, and when Marty McFly takes to the stage for \u201cJohnny B. Goode,\u201d they dance with unbridled joy\u2014that is until Marty takes it a little too far into the rock \u2019n\u2019 roll future and they are left with their jaws dropped.\nWhen I tell people that I choreographed Back to the Future, they sometimes ask about what was choreographed in the film. What people often don\u2019t realize is that when an actor in a film suddenly starts using his or her body to perform to music in a scene, the movement needs to be staged by a choreographer. These kinds of challenges are my favorite. Take an actor\u2014in this case Michael J. Fox\u2014and find a vocabulary in his or her natural movement that I can then design in a sequence to music, thereby making sure that the dance and movement are organic to the actor and character. I have always enjoyed the challenge of working with actors as opposed to dancers.\nWith a professional dancer, you already know that whatever you choreograph, he or she will be able to master the movements both quickly and perfectly. But with actors, the challenge is creating movement drawn from their own movement vocabularies so that the characters they are portraying will be as organic and truthful as possible. What good is asking an actor who is usually untrained in dance to perform movement well out of his or her comfort zone? The whole point is to make it easier and as organic as possible for the actor to be believable dancing and moving as that character. I always have enjoyed the process of getting an actor into the studio and working with him or her to find what physical vocabulary can be used to build a truthful performance.\nWith Back to the Future, the dance and guitar solo that Marty McFly performs turned out to be one of the classic moments of the film.\nWorking with Michael was a joy. He was so enthusiastic and ready to try anything. We were able to get the staging polished in very little time. He was also working on the TV series Family Ties while we were rehearsing and also while filming Back to the Future. He had such wonderful energy and enthusiasm that it was more fun than work to rehearse with him.\nNow as many Back to the Future fans know, Michael J. Fox was the second Marty McFly. The original actor was cast and had started to be filmed when it was decided that Michael was a better fit for the role\u2014but not before I had the chance to begin rehearsing the original Marty. I had one or two rehearsals with that actor before the role was recast with Michael in Marty\u2019s shoes. The first Marty was a great actor, but Marty was really Michael J. Fox\u2019s character to play.\nOn Back to the Future Part II and Back to the Future Part III, I was asked back by Bob Zemeckis to restage the dance sequence for the second film and to create a square dance for the third film, mainly for Mary Steenburgen and Christopher Lloyd. All three films were a joy to work on.\nIn my experience, the tone of the set and work environment is almost always determined by the director, and on the four films I have been fortunate to create on with Bob Zemeckis, there is a level of respect given to all the creative contributors, whether they are set designers, costumers, or in my case choreographer. I have felt that Bob hires the best creative people to work with, and then does something unusual in Hollywood: He lets them do the jobs they were hired to do. All the departments treat one another with so much respect, knowing that if they were there, they were the best.\nMovies: What is the one movie you watched that changed your life the most?\nBack to the Future (1985 movie): What predictions about 2015 in Back to the Future have come true?\nMovies: Why do so many people want Marvel to make a Black Panther and Black Widow movie?",

    "user_prompt": "England moved to the top of Group B after a thrilling 2-1 victory over Wales on Friday thanks to a stoppage-time winner from Daniel Sturridge at the Stade Bollaert-Delelis in Lens, France. Gareth Bale had given the Dragons the lead by scoring his second goal from a free-kick in as many matches. Second-half substitute Jamie Vardy made his presence felt almost instantly to help England begin an attacking surge that finished with Sturridge's heroics. Sami Mokbel of the Daily Mail noted England head coach Roy Hodgson declined to exchange verbal jabs with Wales players, including Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey, leading into the match after they pointed out the English squad seemed to lack passion. \"Talk is talk; action on the field is action on the field,\" Hodgson said. \"It surprises me that people are focusing on the talking. If we really took it seriously, thinking about what people in the other team are saying, and allowed it to affect our concentration, we'd be ashamed of ourselves.\" Disaster nearly struck the Dragons inside the opening 15 seconds as a failed clearance attempt by captain Ashley Williams almost allowed Harry Kane to get an immediate look at goal. The defender recovered in time to avert the danger, though. After that initial heart-stopping moment for the Welsh supporters, it was an otherwise tame opening 30 minutes. Neither side could generate much attacking pressure, and the pre-match remarks by Wales didn't appear to have any impact on the English players' approach. The Three Lions tried picking up the pace in the latter stages of the first half. They shouted for a penalty call after the ball bounced off Ben Davies' hand following an aerial duel in the box with Kane, but referee Felix Brych quickly dismissed the appeals. England continued to turn up the pressure and nearly found the net off a corner kick as Chris Smalling did well to find some space in the box. His ensuing header floated just wide of the post, though. Then, in the final moments of a half where they controlled just 36 per cent of possession, Wales broke the deadlock in a fortuitous manner. A rare Dragons foray into the attacking third created a free-kick opportunity. Although the Bale effort from around 35 yards out was solid, beating the wall and dipping with a good amount of power, Joe Hart should have made the save. He didn't, and the Welsh fans exploded with joy. The more you see Bale's free-kick the worse it gets for Joe Hart. No real deviation. No wonder striker. Just terrible goalkeeping. Hodgson made two changes at half-time, bringing Sturridge on for Raheem Sterling and Vardy on for Kane in an effort to spark more efficient attacking after the break. It only took around 10 minutes for that decision to pay off. Williams accidentally headed the ball toward his own goal, and Vardy, as was so often the case with Leicester City this past season, was in the right spot at the right time to get England back level. The Three Lions were the more active side during the final 30 minutes of the match as they spent a lot of time in opposing territory searching for openings. Wales' vaunted defensive structure held firm and appeared poised to keep the match all square. All it took was one second of defensive chaos to open the door for Sturridge, though. He took full advantage, poking a shot to the near post for the winner just a few minutes before the final whistle. Looking ahead, England are now in a far more promising position than when stoppage time began. Although the job still isn't done, the Three Lions can at least head into their group finale knowing a draw will be enough to guarantee advancement. Wales were mere minutes away from staying in the driver's seat in Group B. Instead, the Dragons must now prepare for a fixture against an extremely desperate Russian side Monday with an eye on earning all three points to make sure it moves on. I am really gutted and absolutely devastated for our fans. But this is tournament football, let's get this out of the way and get up in the morning and make sure our minds and focus is on the next challenge. We have waited so long to be here but there was always going to be disappointments along the way. This is one of them, this is a real tough one but we have to show our mettle and make sure we bounce back. We have 90 minutes to make the most of something we have worked hard for. But what doesn't hurt you makes you stronger. It's a great feeling, unbelievable. I'm grateful for the opportunity from the gaffer. It's a beautiful feeling to represent your country in a great rivalry against another country. It's great. There's one more game in the group to go so no one's getting too excited but the atmosphere is unbelievable, and the togetherness between the two countries is amazing. It's a great feeling and hopefully we can go through. Meanwhile, Hodgson commented on the staff's level of happiness with the victory, which he always felt was within reach despite trailing at halftime, as relayed by BBC Sport. \"It's a long time since myself and the coaching staff have showed such joy,\" he told BBC Radio 5. \"When the chances don't go in and you've compounded your task by conceding that Gareth Bale goal, it really is a happy moment when both the substitutes score. I thought it was on the cards all the way through the second half.\" All match statistics courtesy of the tournament's official site. How did Hodgson respond to Wales players' comments about England's lack of passion before the match?",

    "user_prompt": "1. Mobile is on the move.\nConsumers continue to demonstrate an increasing preference for using mobile devices versus traditional computers. Mobile apps and browsers grab a bigger piece of the online pie every day. As a matter of fact, Google has put a date on when searches made on mobile devices will equal desktop. But if your website isn\u2019t functional on smartphones or tablets, mobile visitors will abandon your site and move on to check out your competition. Therefore, it\u2019s important to develop a mobile-friendly website to capture as much of that mobile traffic as possible.\n2. Never lose a lead.\nLead capture forms are crucial for website design, as this is the most direct way to grow your database of customer contacts and prospective clients. Giveaways, newsletters, and queries are just a few ways to entice visitors to complete your contact form. Once they submit their name and email address, your website can send that information directly to an email service that stores the information, while simultaneously starting an automated email campaign to engage and nurture the prospect. You set all of this up once, and it can run on its own for every person who completes the lead capture form.\nCompelling content continues to be one of the most important web marketing tools available. After all, it\u2019s your interesting and useful content that will keep people reading, visiting, and recommending your website to others. Remember, your written content goes beyond search engine optimization. Your content also has to be optimized for your intended audience.\n4. HTML5 is a rising star.\nBuilding your website using the latest HTML5 technology will help you deliver incredible animations, graphics, videos, and more. It can also allow you to build complicated, interactive web applications for the enjoyment of your website\u2019s visitors. Your competitors are probably stepping up their web design; use this opportunity to do even better.\n5. SEO continues its evolution.\nSEO best practices must always be observed to ensure that people find your website via search engines. Good keywords, strong links, and tags are not going away anytime soon. Do a little research to broaden and strengthen your keywords. See what you can do to clean up your URLs and get a sitemap established.

Given material: Pipe music drifted through the city\u2019s streets today as a parade of colourful floats, proud Irish families and traditional bands came together in Leeds ahead of St Patrick\u2019s Day. Leeds-born DJ Chris Moyles joined the Lord Mayor, Coun Jane Dowson, to cut the ribbon and wave off the 19th Leeds St Patrick\u2019s Day parade. After winding its way through the city centre, the procession returned to Millennium Square where stalls, entertainment and live music kept revellers in high spirits until the party moved to Leeds Irish Centre. Addressing the packed square, parade committee chairman Jackie Dwyer said: \u201cThank you for being here today. This is our 19th year for the parade and I think you must agree it\u2019s been fantastic. Among those welcoming back the procession was 42-year-old Isabelle Hardaker, who was in the company of three generations. Kieran Brady, 47, had taken part in previous years with his old football team and returned this year to join 10-year-old daughter Ruby on the Immaculate Heart float. Schools, sports clubs, Irish dance schools and social clubs were all well represented this year, with St Theresa\u2019s Catholic Primary School taking the trophy for best float. He added: \u201cIt\u2019s an absolute privilege for me to be here today for this fantastic parade. While many of the floats focused on the orange, green and white of the Irish flag, one chose instead to recreate Dublin\u2019s Moore Street Market. Created by Leeds Irish Health and Homes, it was topped off with a clock tower and featured one reveller dressed as Molly Malone. \u201cWe wanted to recreate the nostalgia of the time,\u201d Sara Allkins, of LIHH, said.",

    "user_prompt": "Given the text: At the marketing professional level in Australia, many workshops exist to upskill a professional in digital marketing. Workshops can range from being very specific to very broad in nature.\nFrom first hand experience delivering certificates many times, you can see these certificates can cover a lot of ground!\nWhy is a digital marketing certificate so important to your career?\nA digital marketing certificate is a great asset at any stage of your marketing career, because it quite comprehensively ties in the major aspects of digital marketing and media through a formal process.\nThe digital marketing certificate will enable you to get a broad concept of digital strategy and channels to fast track your career. Sometimes your boss will not have formal qualifications in digital, which means you can be equipped with the needed information to be ready for your next opportunity or promotion.\nAs you change jobs & learn digital through different internal and external partners, a need to round out your knowledge is generally required. To increase your confidence leading strategic digital marketing strategy, you\u2019ll find the certificate will fill in many of the gaps you could have in your knowledge.\nThe digital marketing certificate courses that are ideal for professionals who have 10 or more years can fit into many different categories. Some senior executives love time out of the office, away from family to concentrate and solidify digital channels and strategy. Others are looking to move to the other side of the advertising and marketing fence and use it as process to help change careers.\nWhy are digital marketing certificates \u2018worth it\u2019?\nHaving taught a digital marketing certificate course for almost 8 years in a variety of formats, I can tell you the depth of knowledge you learn in comparison to other learning programs is the major difference.\nIn many programs, guest speakers are introduced to bring an outside perspective beyond the tutors and companies experience.\nThe networking amongst peers is also a great way to establish connections beyond your company. This is particularly important for those who are at an early stage of their marketing career.\nFor those in a junior to mid-level career, a certificate in digital marketing is a great talking point on your CV or LinkedIn profile. In many instances you\u2019ll have lots of digital strategies, channels and techniques to talk about with your potential employer. Speaking to marketing recruiters, I can tell you it\u2019s highly regarded, especially if your manager is not as confident in digital as they would like to be!\nExpect to be challenged, pushed, and even overwhelmed but always keep moving forward! Digital marketing is a broad subject and many providers do their best to pack in as much as they can.\nExams and Assessments. These two are the major differences between a general workshop that you can get at many marketing organisations and private vendors in the marketplace.\nGroup Work. Yep, it\u2019s back to the uni days! Often a final assessment is pulling together all of your knowledge and applying it to a series of briefs. Expect to meet up in the classroom before class, another week night, or sometimes even the weekend. Either way, you\u2019ll need to find some way of collaboration. Handy hint \u2013 use Google docs & Google Drive to share your knowledge and work between your team.\nHow can you learn the materials?\nFace-to-face evening classes \u2013 Just when it\u2019s time to head home, it\u2019s off to marketing class we go! This is often run on a Wednesday evening from 6:00 pm \u2013 9:00 pm.\nFace-to-face during business hours \u2013 Instead of heading to work, you\u2019ll be heading to class. These usually happen over a period of 2-3 months held in CBD locations across Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane. Workshops are generally 9:00 am \u2013 5:00 pm with regular breaks. This is a great way to balance learning without eating into too much of your personal time. But don\u2019t forget, there is group work and assessment to do outside of class.\nOnline \u2013 If you are an individual who is committed to learning in your own environment, at least 2 providers in the industry currently offer the qualification online. Be wary that the quality of learning is just not the same as face to face. It\u2019s very difficult to ask a video, infographic or table a question! Whilst you may be able to email a tutor, it is still no substitute for being in front of a tutor with a small group of people.\nWho provides digital marketing certificate courses in Australia?\nWhat should I ask to make sure I\u2019ve selected the right course provider?\nWho will be the tutor or tutors I\u2019m learning from?\nHow many hours will it take to finish the course?\nHow many assessment points are there?\nIs the course strategy based, practical, or both? If so which one does it skew?\nWhat is your refund policy if the first day is not up to expectations?\nCan I speak to past graduates who have finished the course?\nWhat are the approximate costs of these courses?\nExpect to pay around $3500 \u2013 $8000 AUD for a certificate or diploma of digital marketing.\nSo there you have it! That\u2019s the FAQ\u2019s of the digital marketing certificate courses available in Australia right now.\nDo you have any other questions that we didn\u2019t answer? Please leave your question below and we will do out best to get back to you.\nWhat options are available for learning digital marketing materials, and what are the major differences between them?",

    "user_prompt": "The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by the 193 UN member states in 2015 provide a shared framework for tackling the biggest and most important sustainability challenges in the world: from environmental, economic, social and cultural development, with each goal which branches off into a separate list of indicators and precise objectives.\nReaching the SDGs requires concrete commitment not only from governments and companies, but also from investors. It is estimated that by 2030 it will take 90 trillion dollars to reach the SDGs.\nGlobal Reporting Initiative (GRI), Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) and the United Nations Global Compact have published ten useful business recommendations to meet investor needs and to stimulate more investment to contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG).\nIt is no coincidence that the three entities (GRI, PRI and the United Nations Global Compact) represent the world's leading organizations in the areas of sustainability reporting, corporate responsibility and responsible investment.\nThe recommendations then focus on how corporate reporting can respond to investor needs to mobilize sustainable and long-term funding needed to achieve the SDGs.\nFiona Reynolds CEO of PRI, stated that \"the globally agreed SDGs are an articulation of the most urgent environmental, social and economic issues in the world and as such, act as a definitive list of material factors that investors should consider as part of their fiduciary obligation\".\nThe joint initiative has the main objective of helping companies to measure and manage their impacts on SDGs. This once again confirms the priority role of the private sector in the fight against climate change: and raising awareness of the importance of achieving the SDGs that a long-term sustainable business model can be affirmed in the private sector.\nDiscussion of the role of the private sector in accelerating progress in SDGs and how business decisions have a direct impact on specific objectives is of paramount importance.\nClimate change is a global issue and the action of governments and institutions is not enough: this means that the private sector can play a very important role in the fight against climate change, concentrating the activities of reducing emissions into low-cost options and in the conscious choice of financing in line with the company objectives and mission.\nIf sustainable development goals (SDGs) are to be achieved, policymakers must focus less on individual goals and more on the links between the 17 goals to create a cleaner, more sustainable and fairer world by 2030.\nThe recommendations require an effort by the whole company, and not only, with the support of organizations such as GRI, PRI and the UN Global Compact, companies and the investor community should continue to work and learn together to promote the best reporting practices on corporate sustainability in support of the SDGs.\nThis will allow the private sector and investors to contribute significantly to the 2030 Agenda, opening up opportunities for businesses and investors - and ultimately the whole of society - to benefit.

    "user_prompt": "Stir together flour and paprika and place on flat plate. Whisk together eggs, soy milk and lemon juice. Dredge chicken in flour and then dip in egg mixture. Place on a baking sheet and chill for 1 hour (this is the secret step!) Pour oil into a large skillet \u2013 electric or otherwise. The oil should be about 2 inches deep. Heat and add chicken when sizzling. Fry for about 10 minutes on each side \u2013 until golden brown. Reduce heat, cover and cook for an additional 20 minutes. Drain on paper towel. Alternatively, after frying 10 minutes on each side, drain immediately on paper towels. Remove from paper towels and place in a baking pan in a preheated 350 degree oven and bake for about 20 minutes. This entry was posted in Recipes of the Week, Weekly Recipes and tagged Chanukah, chicken, Hanukah by . Bookmark the permalink. This is specifically a recipe for fried chicken, for those occasions when you want to indulge. For other times, you can try our oven fried chicken \u2013 https://gourmetkoshercooking.com/2010/09/oven-fried-chicken-2/ . Im excited to try this.. I like to prepare dinner while the kids are in school. Can I prepare it in the morning, and keep it in the fridge till Im ready to fry it ? ? On the fried chicken recipe you di the chicken in the egg mixture last, then chill it..Is that correct, or should the chicken cbe dipped in the egg mixture, and flour mixture last? The instructions to put the flour on first, then the egg mixture, is the most important step. It will not work well the other way around if you put the egg mixture first, because you will end up with dried flour on the outside, which burns and is tasteless. My chicken was already cold from marinating in salt and pepper overnight, so it did not seem to hurt for me to refrigerate for only about 10 min after coating the chicken. I used peanut oil to cook the chicken and for the first time, I got a nice crispy crust. I will play with different seasonings for the egg and flour mixtures to maximize flavor. It says to put the chicken on for 10 mins. on each side\u2026 So that means what should the fire number be on ? High or medium I don\u2019t want to have burnt fr chicken. Since the oil needs to be sizzling, the fire needs to be on the high side; if it\u2019s start to get too dark, just turn the flame down slightly. Enjoy! where is the butter milk for marination, as u get the best results after the lactic acid re acts with chicken protein, so marinade in butter milk. This recipe was amazing! Is there a recommended type of oil to use for frying the chicken in this recipe?",

The symposium will also explore fate, hazard and exposure evaluation, and characterization of uncertainty. Chemicals management regulatory programs have experienced an explosion of international activity as regulatory authorities prioritize the need to systematically assess the ecological risks associated with chemicals in commerce. The emergence of these chemicals management regulatory programs has been accompanied by an equivalent growth in the science associated with their implementation. The scientific community has been especially active in the refinement of risk-based WoE methods and techniques to evaluate the risks from exposure to chemicals. As an international leader in advancing the science associated with ecological assessment, this symposium further illustrates SETAC\u2019s longstanding tradition of bringing practical solutions to environmental challenges.\nRegister today!

    "user_prompt": "Can you summarize the process of how the protagonist was carried to the capital city and chained up in the temple?\nGenerate according to: They guessed that a small quantity would not suffice me, and, being a most ingenious people, they slung up one of their largest hogsheads, then rolled it toward my hand, and beat out the top. I drank it off at a draught, which I might well do, for it did not hold half a pint. They brought me a second hogshead, which I drank, and made signs for more; but they had none to give me. However, I could not wonder enough at the daring of these tiny mortals, who ventured to mount and walk upon my body, while one of my hands was free, without trembling at the very sight of so huge a creature as I must have seemed to them. After some time there appeared before me a person of high rank from his Imperial Majesty. His Excellency, having mounted my right leg, advanced to my face, with about a dozen of his retinue, and spoke about ten minutes, often pointing forward, which, as I afterward found, was toward the capital city, about half a mile distant, whither it was commanded by his Majesty that I should be conveyed. I made a sign with my hand that was loose, putting it to the other (but over his Excellency's head, for fear of hurting him or his train), to show that I desired my liberty. He seemed to understand me well enough, for he shook his head, though he made other signs to let me know that I should have meat and drink enough, and very good treatment. Then I once more thought of attempting to escape; but when I felt the smart of their arrows on my face and hands, which were all in blisters and observed likewise that the number of my enemies increased, I gave tokens to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased.\nThen they daubed my face and hands with a sweet-smelling ointment, which in a few minutes removed all the smarts of the arrows. The relief from pain and hunger made me drowsy, and presently I fell asleep. I slept about eight hours, as I was told afterward; and it was no wonder, for the physicians, by the Emperor's orders, had mingled a sleeping draught in the hogsheads of wine. It seems that, when I was discovered sleeping on the ground after my landing, the Emperor had early notice of it, and determined that I should be tied in the manner I have related (which was done in the night, while I slept), that plenty of meat and drink should be sent me, and a machine prepared to carry me to the capital city. Five hundred carpenters and engineers were immediately set to work to prepare the engine. It was a frame of wood, raised three inches from the ground, about seven feet long and four wide, moving upon twenty-two wheels. But the difficulty was to place me on it. Eighty poles were erected for this purpose, and very strong cords fastened to bandages which the workmen had tied round my neck, hands, body, and legs. Nine hundred of the strongest men were employed to draw up these cords by pulleys fastened on the poles, and in less than three hours I was raised and slung into the engine, and there tied fast. Fifteen hundred of the Emperor's largest horses, each about four inches and a half high, were then employed to draw me toward the capital. But while all this was done I still lay in a deep sleep, and I did not wake till four hours after we began our journey.\nThe Emperor and all his Court came out to meet us when we reached the capital; but his great officials would not suffer his Majesty to risk his person by mounting on my body. Where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple, supposed to be the largest in the whole kingdom, and here it was determined that I should lodge. Near the great gate, through which I could easily creep, they fixed ninety-one chains, like those which hang to a lady's watch, which were locked to my left leg with thirty-six padlocks; and when the workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose, they cut all the strings that bound me. Then I rose up, feeling as melancholy as ever I did in my life. But the noise and astonishment of the people on seeing me rise and walk were inexpressible. The chains that held my left leg were about two yards long, and gave me not only freedom to walk backward and forward in a semicircle, but to creep in and lie at full length inside the temple. The Emperor, advancing toward me from among his courtiers, all most magnificently clad, surveyed me with great admiration, but kept beyond the length of my chain.\nHe was taller by about the breadth of my nail than any of his Court, which alone was enough to strike awe into the beholders, and graceful and majestic. The better to behold him, I lay down on my side, so that my face was level with his, and he stood three yards off. However, I have had him since many times in my hand, and therefore cannot be deceived. His dress was very simple; but he wore a light helmet of gold, adorned with jewels and a plume. He held his sword drawn in his hand, to defend himself if I should break loose; it was almost three inches long, and the hilt was of gold, enriched with diamonds. His voice was shrill, but very clear. His Imperial Majesty spoke often to me, and I answered; but neither of us could understand a word.",

    "user_prompt": "Given the text: While our lovely Annie recovers from the summer flu, let\u2019s share some of our favorite summer reads\u2026 anything! What are you reading? What do you want to be reading? What book can you not leave home without on your summer vacation? What do you read to cheer you up when you\u2019re sick?\nHeidi \u2013 I\u2019m reading a lot of YA right now. Some of it is older (Stargirl by Jerry Spinelli) and some of it is new (Shiver, Linger, Forever by Maggie Stiefvater). I\u2019m reading YA for a couple of reasons \u2013 1 \u2013 entertaining and engaging characters \u2013 2- I am not as familiar with YA authors and need to do some severe weeding and rebuilding in my library\u2019s collection. I\u2019m also reading a book about quilting because if I ever have spare time I want to sew a quilt.\nI\u2019m reading Brooklyn by Colm Toibin for my book club. It\u2019s fantastic. Although it takes place right after WWII it is reminding me of times in my life where I have been utterly homesick for my family. Interesting to read about being away from home before emails and Skype existed!\nI\u2019ve been reading a fair amount of J/YA as well. Mostly Garth Nix\u2019s Keys to the Kingdom series and his Sabriel/Lisrael/Abhorsen trilogy. Great stuff. Quick reads too.\nBased on a recommendation, I\u2019ve also started the Gentlemen Bastards series by Scott Lynch. Very pirates-type feel to it. First book was really good.\nI also recently read No Shelf Required based on the HackLibrary review!\nYes! I read No Shelf Required, too. I thought it was a great way to be introduced to not only ereading and ebooks but the processes and standards (or lackthereof) of it all. You\u2019ll have to come back to Rebecca\u2019s review and add your own comments when you\u2019re done.\nI\u2019m reading Snow Crash by Neal Stephenson and Mindfulness in Plain English by Bhante Henepola Gunaratana. During the summer months, when I\u2019m not as busy at work, I like to read one fiction and one non-fiction simultaneously (for me, this makes it easier mentally to switch from one book to the other). During the year, when free time isn\u2019t as abundant, I\u2019m usually reading one book at a time.\nI like to do one fiction, one non-fiction, too. Actually, while I was in school, I was sometimes reading one fiction, one non-fiction and listening to a book at the same time. I don\u2019t usually have trouble keeping them apart. I\u2019ve often thought it would be fun to experiment by keeping a different book in each room of my house to see if where I end up reading most often is the place that\u2019s most comfortable or the place with the \u201cbest\u201d book at the moment.\nThroughout the year I try to read an average of one book a week\u2026two books I finished recently that I loved were \u201cOne Day\u201d by David Nicholls (film adaptation out in August starring Anne Hathaway) and \u201cThe Sisters Brothers\u201d by Patrick Dewolff. I also finally read \u201cLife of Pi\u201d and hated it. As for YA, I just read \u201cCity of Fallen Angels\u201d \u2014 the fourth book in the Mortal Instruments series. And I just started on \u201cThe Poison Tree\u201d by Erin Kelly.\nI try reading a book a week too, but the last few years I\u2019ve failed spectacularly and have fallen to a book every other month. Right now is week three of The Picture of Dorian Grey, which I\u2019m about 15 pages in.\nAs you already know, I love YA\u2026and especially love Stargirl. \ud83d\ude42 I just finished THE NIGHT CIRCUS by Erin Morgenstern and loved it. It\u2019s quite captivating. I think I\u2019m going to read a classic next \u2013 perhaps A CONNECTICUT YANKEE IN KING ARTHUR\u2019S COURT by Mark Twain.\nFor summer I tend to read mysteries. Right now I\u2019m working on the latest in the Maisie Dobbs series. They are all set after World War I in England, where Maisie is a private detective, sounds cheesy, but they are great reads.\nUntil my summer class ends, I\u2019m supplementing school with middle-grade fiction (A Long Way from Chicago, at the moment). First on my list after school (one more week!) is Carolyn Cooke\u2019s Daughters of the Revolution.\nWhat is the latest book in the Maisie Dobbs series that you're currently reading?",

    "user_prompt": "Can you summarize the benefits of practicing Yoga Nidra and how it helped the author cope with insomnia?\nGenerate according to: I have personally experienced episodes of sleep difficulties. At one stage, I even resorted to sleeping pills.\nBut as the old saying goes, \u201ceverything happens for a reason\u201d, and it proved very true in this case as it was one of the reasons why I took an interest in yoga. To cope with insomnia, I decided to try Yoga Nidra.\nYoga Nidra is a practice where you lay down and are guided into a deep relaxation while staying completely present. It\u2019s been said that practicing 30 minutes of Yoga Nidra promotes as much restoration in the body as four hours of sleep!\nSo I thought, \u201cWell, if I\u2019m not sleeping then at least by listening to this CD I\u2019ll be able to restore my body.\u201d I practiced every day and eventually the insomnia just stopped. I had been taught how to completely relax.\nWhen you completely relax the physical body while being awake you cultivate feelings of calm and peace, the more you practice those feelings the easier it is to draw upon those feelings to help you to relax enough to sleep.\nA busy mind while lying in bed is something we all experience at some point in our lives. Writing down whatever is floating around in your mind is helpful. After you\u2019ve written it down, it\u2019s like it is out of your head, so you can change your energy to allow yourself to relax.\nA visualisation technique is brilliant because it gives your monkey mind a branch to hold on to. You can draw in your concentration to something beautiful and relaxing. That shift in energy can then enable you to drift off.\nLike Yoga Nidra, you first start with a body rotation. With each exhalation of your breath, feel your body slip deeper and deeper into relaxation. Bring all of your attention to your right hand thumb, and imagine all tension releasing from that right hand thumb.\nThen feel a deep sense of relaxation in your right hand thumb, letting that feeling move through to the index finger and so on until you have your whole right hand in deep relaxation.\nThen move up your arm and slowly down the right hand side of your body, finishing at the toes. Then start with your left hand thumb, and move through the left side of your body. Say these words to yourself: \u201cI feel a deep sense of relaxation\u201d.\nAfter the whole left side of your body is relaxed, rest the back of your head and move over the face and down to the heart centre. Now that your whole body is relaxed, notice how that feels.\nAfter the body rotation is complete, start with this visualisation technique.\nImagine a beautiful field with the sun shining and soft, green grass. Feel the soft, green grass under your feet. Looking up, see a beautiful big tree and slowly walk towards it, taking in the beauty of nature. When you reach the tree, sit or lay down, enjoying the peacefulness of nature. Notice how peaceful and happy you are. This is your garden of relaxation. You can continue looking around at your garden with beautiful flowers and bird song, and the sound of the tree leaves in the breeze. Exist here.\nCultivating and creating peace in your mind is essential for shifting your energy. Often giving ourselves the chance to relax is all it takes to drift off into a blissful sleep.",

    "user_prompt": "Here is a piece of text: A report from the Nueces County IT department shows the system contributed to saving the county thousands in juror pay. For many, jury duty can seem like more of a chore than anything. But officials in Nueces County have been trying to save people time for those notified to serve. It's been more than a year since the county gave people the option to select online jury impaneling when they receive their jury summons in the mail. \"People are so used to texting now and looking at their email and using an iPhone, that once we started there was ... more than a 50 percent response to going online,\" District Clerk Anne Lorentzen said. It's routine for potential jurors, sometimes by the hundreds, to report to the central jury room on the first floor of the Nueces County Courthouse. Court staff have dubbed the process the \"cattle call.\" Now, jurors selected for online impanelment may be able to bypass that log jam \u2014 and the crowd \u2014 and report directly to a specific courtroom. Now, a report from the county's IT department credits the system with having contributed to saving thousands of dollars. For fiscal year 2016-2017, the first full year of the system, juror pay was reduced by $346,600, according to the report. Jurors get $10 for the first day of jury duty and $40 for each day after. There was an increase of $13,600 in text messaging costs for the county, but a $17,537 decrease in summons printing and postage, making the total net savings from the online jury system $350,537 according to the report. \"That $350,000 is important,\" said Mike Pusley, one of the people to head up bringing the system to the county. \"It's big no doubt, but I think that is a drop in the bucket compared to what we're saving employer and people on time coming down to this courthouse.\" Pusley recently stepped down as a Precinct 1 county commissioner, and is now running for Nueces County judge. Judge Sandra Watts in October attributed parts of the cost savings to judges being able to avoid bringing in a panel if they're no longer needed. \"We do a blast email, a blast text saying \u2018Thank you for your jury services, but your services are not going to be needed,' \" Watts said. \"Every time we send one of those out, that\u2019s a $10 per person savings.\" Lorentzen said the county has been able to eliminate the Tuesday \"cattle call\" in the central jury room on the courthouse's first floor. The overall number of summons mailed out also dropped from the past fiscal year. From October 2015 to September 2016, 100,529 summons were sent out, compared with 87,410 from October 2016 to September 2017, the report states. Still, those summoned, whether they opt for online or walk-in, failed to appear for jury duty in comparable numbers. Those are the people who never responded to their jury summons. Thirty-three percent of people summoned failed to appear from October 2016 to September 2017 compared to 35 percent in the fiscal year before. Some attorneys aren't convinced. Corpus Christi attorney David Bright said he has \"very serious concerns\" about the randomness of the panel. \"If you gather a jury panel, solely of people who have this qualification in common: that they all have a computer and feel more comfortable emailing in or they feel more comfortable texting in than they do showing up, by definition you have further refined the group,\" he said. \"You've made it un-random.\" Lorentzen said the county can accommodate those attorneys not wanting a online panel for their trial. But for those who do show up, some found the online system preferable. Corpus Christi nurse Blanca Rodriguez, 47, said she's done online impanelment twice. \"Before you'd have to fill out the paper and send it in and you wouldn't hear anything, and now with the online, they get all of your information and you get your text messages,\" Rodriguez said. \"You don't have to go downstairs, (for) the 'cattle call' like she calls it. I think the system is a lot simpler and faster doing it that way.\" Based on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: How has the online jury impaneling system been received by potential jurors in Nueces County?",

    "user_prompt": "Could you paraphrase the comment made about maintaining the original paint color on the Jeep and explain the author's response to the suggestion?: Id go with the blue. Id like that with the wheels you picked out.\nNice wheels! I dig both colors but theres something about the Chestnut that reminds me of a classic CJ.\nGot the new 15x12 wheels mounted up and this time put the black walls out. I had spun one tire/wheel around and put it next to another and noticed not only did I like the look a bit better, but the black wall gave the illusion that the tire was bigger than the other one. So that's the way I went. I used the center caps from the old wheels and they worked perfectly.\nAlso, I had ordered the bumper hoop from Rock Hard and it came in on Friday. I didn't order it with the bumper originally because I wasn't sure if I wanted do that, being that my last two Jeep had hoops. Ever since, the bumper has just looked like it needed it, and it'll give the future winch some level of protection from brush.\nI think these were good additions and I really like the way tires look on the wheels as much as the wheels themselves. They stick out just the right amount for my tastes. About as much as a 10 inch wheel on a TJ. Overall I am pleased with the direction it's going.\nSince I bought the CJ, I have been pondering what color to paint it.\nArgh, bummed to see mention of painting this awesome patina \u20185!\nThey only wear their original paint once!\nI\u2019d think hard about keeping it the color it came, but that other blue is fine looking.\nIt seems the suggestions on color are split pretty evenly between the blue and the brown. With one vote for green.\nFunny thing is there was a Golden Eagle that came in green. It did make me at least consider going with green metallic.\nI wonder how it would look in the new Mojito green from the JL line? It would be different, and probably awesome.\nNow I have three colors to choose from.",

    "user_prompt": "When Dell announced they\u2019d made $3 million in sales through their Twitter promotions it was lauded as a triumph for social media. The numbers, however, tell a far different story.\nDell recently announced that over the past two years it has made $3 million in sales on Twitter, one-third of that during the last six months when the Twitter population grew by 1,000%.\nAccording to Dell, they created their own tracking software for the project, and issue six to ten Dell specials a day. That is a not-insubstantial allocation of resources being used for a following of 779,010 people \u2014 although the initial outlay for creating the software is a one-time cost. Upkeep, however, will be ongoing, and while it may not be terribly expensive, neither is it peanuts.\nAnd what have they got? While three million sounds like a lot, their quarterly intake was $12.3 billion, which makes their two-year Twitter take equivalent to 0.024% of what they\u2019ve made through three months of sales procured through the boring, traditional methods.\nTo put this in terms of profit-per-day, during one quarter, Dell makes $131,550,802 a day. That\u2019s $131 million. During their two years on Twitter, however, they only made $4,109 a day. That\u2019s $4 thousand. This is a daily profit of %0.003 \u2014 some of which must have been eaten up in the costs maintaining the program.\nIs it a failure? No. Dell is using Twitter the way another company might put up posters on telephone posts: it\u2019s cheap, and any resulting sales are pretty much pure profit (aside from the cost of the guy putting up the posters). But Dell is not fooling themselves into believing that the experiment is worth any real outlay on their part. If Twitter collapsed tomorrow Dell would barely notice \u2014 although a couple of their employees might be yanked away from the Internet and have to go back to real work.\nClive Maclean suggests that Dell\u2019s two-year involvement with Twitter probably \u201cdid not happen as a result of an agency recommendation,\u201d by which he means to imply that an agency would not be forward-looking enough to suggest such a ploy.\nWell, I certainly hope not \u2014 at least not as anything more than an extremely low-priority experiment. The real wakeup call here is for the clients, not the agencies: if your agency is pushing social marketing in a really big way \u2014 get another agency.\nDon\u2019t believe me? Just take a look at the latest social marketing \u201csuccess\u201d figures from Dell.\nOriginally published in the \u201cAd Nauseam\u201d column, 2007. Based on the passage above, What does Clive Maclean suggest about Dell's involvement with Twitter and agency recommendations?",

    "user_prompt": "Here is a piece of text: Club officials, even at the time, privately acknowledged Cano, then 31, was unlikely to remain an elite player throughout the decade-long commitment.\nThey do, though, believe he can be a productive player as he closes in on age 40 \u2014 and they see no reason he can\u2019t remain among the game\u2019s best players for several years.\nCertainly, Cano gave no reason last season to alter that view.\nHis on-field performance mirrored his career norms in nearly all areas except home runs. He was picked as an All-Star and, as he did in 2013, finished fifth in balloting for the American League\u2019s Most Valuable Player.\nMore than that, though, Cano helped transform the Mariners in the manner that club officials hoped and envisioned. Tellingly, he put down a marker in early May just as the Mariners were climbing out of an eight-game spin.\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you one thing,\u201d he said, \u201cI have a lot of confidence that we\u2019re going to be there at the end of the season. Here\u2019s what I\u2019m saying: There\u2019s going to be a point when it all comes together.\nIt played out pretty much that way.\nThe Mariners rode their pitching staff, which led the American League in earned-run average, to an 87-75 record, which marked a 16-victory improvement over 2013.\nThey remained in postseason contention until midway through the final game of the season. Oddly, perhaps, the moment they were eliminated turned into one of the season\u2019s highlights.\nOnce the scoreboard at Safeco Field confirmed Oakland had clinched the final wild-card berth by winning at Texas, the crowd rose and cheered.\nThe Mariners were relevant again. Attendance at Safeco soared past 2 million for the first time in four years. The 17 percent increase over the previous year was the biggest jump in the majors.\nFor all that, the way last season ended left a sour taste. The Mariners\u2019 postseason drought, which now stands at 13 years, is the second-longest among the sport\u2019s 30 franchises. Only Toronto\u2019s is longer.\n\u201cOne thing I want to impress upon our fans,\u201d manager Lloyd McClendon said. \u201cWe are not satisfied with the year that we had. We\u2019re pleased with the improvements that we made. But in the end, we want to win a World Series.\nThe Mariners believe they found that bat earlier this month when they signed free-agent outfielder Nelson Cruz, a right-handed hitter, to a four-year deal for $57 million.\nCruz led the majors last season with 40 homers and chose the Mariners, he said, because it was the \u201cright fit\u201d \u2014 notwithstanding Safeco\u2019s reputation for muting power hitters.\n\u201cI\u2019m here to win,\u201d Cruz declared. \u201cThat\u2019s why I say this is the right fit. We have one of the best starting pitchers and one of the best bullpens in the league.\nHave the Mariners really become a destination franchise for players looking to win? Just asking the question shows how much things have changed in a year.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like I said when I first signed here,\u201d Cano said, \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of great young talent. Guys who are going to be superstars. The bullpen did a great job. So did the starting rotation.\nSpring training starts in less than eight weeks.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: How did Nelson Cruz's signing impact the Mariners' outlook for the future?",

    "user_prompt": "How do you ensure the emails you send out are personalized and tailored to each recipient on the list? Answer according to: Email Marketing is a highly effective way of reaching out directly to the consumers you want and potentially having them as your clients. Email marketing has proven to be a 45% more effective method to convert your prospects into loyal paying customers.\nGenerally, we look into the what industry your company is and we categorize the different types of potential clients and create an email list, targeting the customers and audience you want. The goal is to build the contact list that fits your company. We would always rather create a smaller, targeted email list of clients who will actually engage with you, as opposed to mass email lists who don\u2019t even open their emails.\nOnce we have the email list created, we reach out to them with personalized made emails for each. Our goal is to earn their trust, make them interested and get them to reach back to us to want to know more. We want to build the connection and create a business relationship.\nThese smaller email lists are also useful for sending regular updates out on offers, sales, discounts or new products.\nWe start off with data mining and customer research. This will take some time, as we want to create the most accurate and targeted list possible. We can then start sending emails using an email address from your company website.This way, vendors will be able to trust the sender, and know we are not scamming or sending out spam. We will require a catalog of your company products to give to vendors who are interested.\nWhile we create the email list for you, there will be instances when the email or contact person will not be available. We can then reach out by calling the company.",

    "user_prompt": "How can QR codes be used to link print media adverts to online marketing channels? Answer according to: When you distribute marketing messages online or offline, they are meant to work together to achieve a common goal. The goal is to capture leads, nurture them and turn them into paying customers. Integrating online marketing like social media, email and search engine marketing with offline marketing campaigns like print adverts, direct mail, TV, radio and community events helps you to guide your prospect through your sales funnel and help them to make that important buying decision whether they meet you online or offline.\nOffline clients search for you online: 75 percent of customers will try to read about your business online. So having an online presence is necessary even if your main source of revenue is offline.\nMany online ads are ignored: Forrester research revealed that the total amount of money spent on ads online including social media, email, display, mobile and search is 26 percent of all that companies spend on ads annually. But research by Nielsen showed that up to 49 percent of online ads are not viewed.\nMost offline ads get read: About 90 percent of direct mail recipients will read the printed flyer or brochure but their responses are difficult to track. In contrast, online ads with a lower response rate are completely trackable and rates of return are easy to measure.\nNow that you know why you need to complement one marketing platform with the other, here are some of the most effective ways to combine your online and offline marketing to achieve a higher return on your marketing investment.\nYou can link all print media adverts to your online marketing channels with QR codes. Almost all smartphones have code readers. This makes it easy for users to get instant access to facts about your products and services on one of your webpages. After providing product information, you can offer coupon codes that encourage users to buy quickly and enjoy a discount at your online store. But how do you encourage prospects to scan your QR codes? All you have to do is provide an enticing call-to-action in your print ad and make the code look attractive enough to be scanned. You may also track your campaign with a QR management tool.\nPlace a call-to-action on your offline ad platforms like catalogs, flyers and billboards to increase the rate of conversion. If you place your email and web address or discount coupons in print ads, prospects can see them and take the desired action. To measure the success of your campaign, add a special URL that will allow you to know the number of people that visited the site from your print ad. For instance, you can write a phrase like: \u201cfor a 20% discount on XYZ product, visit www.yourcompanyurl.com, offer is for the first 100 visitors\u201d or \u201cdiscover how this product helped our client to raise marketing ROI by 200% in 2 months\u201d.\nA report by BI Intelligence showed that almost half of smartphone users in the US use their phones while watching TV. In fact one out of five tablet users bought a product promoted on a TV commercial. This means you can combine and complement your marketing on TV and social media. For instance, you can analyze your social media fan base to know where your brand is popular. With this data, you may pay for local TV ads that will reach the audience in that location. This way, you could get more people to visit your social media platform and take a buying decision. Your social engagement can also serve as means of tracking the effectiveness of your TV adverts.\nProduct demos that are tailored to meet your needs.\nWhen you are integrating your offline and online marketing strategies, you need to promote your product or brand with a consistent message. The focus must always be to move them through the sales funnel faster and guide them toward closing the sale.",

    "user_prompt": "Can you summarize the achievements of Paula Apsell and her impact on science journalism through her work at NOVA?: In 2008 Paula Apsell phoned Powderhouse Productions, a Boston-area production company, and uttered a sentence that most likely had never been spoken before (or since) by any executive producer in the history of television: \u201cWe want to make four hours about Materials Science\u201d. For those unfamiliar with the term, Materials Science is exactly what it sounds like \u2014 the study of basic materials. Universities with Materials Science departments offer classes with titles like \u201cReinforced Concrete\u201d & \u201cMicrostructural Dynamics.\u201d The challenge of turning this topic into an entertaining TV series probably ranks as just slightly easier than attempting to make a feature doc about the color beige. But nevertheless, it is science and so by definition, as far as Paula was concerned, there ought to be a story embedded somewhere in the topic. What resulted was the successful and popular mini-series called Making Stuff.\nToday, the toughest challenges we face at NOVA aren\u2019t always topic driven. And for that reason, this award could not come at a better time. As Paula often repeats: science and science journalism are under siege as never before. At NOVA we all feel it acutely. That\u2019s partly why it\u2019s so important to recognize Paula\u2019s willingness to tackle tough topics and tell stories aimed at general audiences in an effort to raise science literacy and promote critical thinking among the millions of viewers who tune in or stream the programs made by NOVA\u2019s indefatigable filmmakers.\nNot many broadcasters would have the temerity to tackle string theory in \u201cThe Elegant Universe\u201d or the theory of General Relativity in a film like \u201cInside Einstein\u2019s Mind,\u201d which premiered on the 100th anniversary of the publication of that world-altering theory. Likewise, there aren\u2019t many who would commission a two-hour film about the least visible objects in the universe \u2014 black holes \u2014 finding a way to make them visible by hitching a ride on the imaginations and passions of the physicists and astronomers who study them. Not to mention, simultaneously showcasing the outsized contributions of women scientists working in the field. And in recent years, Paula has found purpose in probing the intersection of science and social justice \u2014 commissioning films like \u201cPoisoned Water\u201d about the Flint water crisis, a film honored this year with an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Science and Technology Documentary.\nOver her long career Paula has provided a platform for great science communicators, whether as protagonists in quests to solve mysteries, or as hosts like Neil DeGrasse Tyson, David Pogue, Kirk Johnson, Janna Levin or Brian Greene. It\u2019s editorial choices like these that challenge public perceptions of science as remote or inaccessible, and reveal instead the inherent drama and beauty of the human struggle to understand the natural world.\nThis ever-evolving, eclectic mix of stories across all facets of science, engineering, history and the natural world are what NOVA is known for and is responsible for keeping NOVA at the forefront of science journalism for 45 years \u2014 fully 2/3rds of that history, we note, with Paula\u2019s hand firmly on the tiller. NOVA began in 1974 as an experiment inspired by the British science series Horizon. But under Paula\u2019s leadership it has reached an ever-wider national and international audience to become the American icon that it is today. Over her long tenure, Paula has demonstrated a dedication to NOVA\u2019s viewers that is unsurpassed among us. She tries to see the entirety of the world and current affairs of the day through the filter of science journalism; always on the lookout for the stories that will entertain and nourish our audience.\nAs Paula so often reminds us \u2014 science is not a thing. It is a story. It is an endeavor that has its roots in our fundamental humanity and in the curiosity we can trace to our primate ancestors. And each week NOVA proudly sets out to tell those stories.\nWe are so fortunate to have joined Paula Apsell in the eminently worthwhile work that NOVA has been doing for more than 40 years and we are looking forward to the decades to come.\nJulia Cort is Deputy Executive Producer of NOVA.\nChris Schmidt is Senior Producer of NOVA.",

    "user_prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Can Starbucks reduce costs by dropping prices to attract more customers, and what is the main factor that causes the logistics costs to be so high in China?\n\nPassage: Why Is Starbucks So Expensive in China?\nImagine walking into Starbucks and discovering that your grande latte cost $27. You'd probably think that the world's coffee supply had suddenly vanished. Or that you'd traveled by time machine many decades into the future.\nThese inflated prices gives you a pretty good idea of the relative cost (adjusted to per capita income) of what a Chinese person pays for the drink. China's per capita income, at about $7,200, is around five and a half times less than the American figure. Yet at a Starbucks in Beijing, a grande latte goes for about $4.80\u2014or a dollar more than what it costs in the United States. A simple beverage of espresso and steamed milk is pretty damned expensive in China.\nConsidering this, it's a small miracle that Starbucks is still in business there at all. But in fact, the Seattle-based caffeine empire's China operations are thriving. Last December, Bloomberg reported that Starbucks plans to double its China workforce by 2015, adding hundreds of new stores in cities across the country in the process. The company even expects China to become its second largest market\u2014behind just the United States\u2014by this time.\nIn fairness, per capita income is a crude way to measure the buying power of Starbucks' actual customer base: The majority of its stores are located in China's large, coastal cities, where most people earn a lot more than the nationwide per capita average. Nevertheless, it's striking that in a developing country, one lacking an indigenous coffee-drinking culture, so many people are willing to pay a premium for Starbucks products. Logically, wouldn't it make sense for Starbucks to drop its prices a little in order to attract even more customers?\nWhat's expensive are the logistics. The coffee beans Starbucks brews in its Beijing stores, as well as other materials like cups and mugs, don't cost any more to import in China than in the United States. The problem is getting these materials from point A to point B. \"Transporting coffee beans from, say, Colombia to the port of Tianjin is about the same as transporting them from Colombia to the port of Los Angeles,\" says David Wolf, a public relations professional and expert in Chinese business. \"It's getting them from the port in Tianjin to the store in Beijing that's expensive.\" China has invested billions of dollars over the years to improve its port and transportation infrastructure, but the combination of taxes, fees, and middle-men add to logistics costs\u2014which are then passed on to customers in the form of marked-up frappuccinos and lattes.\nSo if Starbucks is so expensive in China, why do so many people go there? Most cities in the country have coffee shops that provide a roughly similar cup of coffee\u2014and similarly comfortable atmosphere\u2014at much lower prices. How does Starbucks make it work?\nOne major issue is culture. Since the Chinese economy opened up to import products in the late 1970s, these goods acquired a certain cachet with image-conscious consumers. \"Traditionally foreign products were regarded as better-made, higher-status, and simply nicer,\" Fei Wang, a Washington, DC-based consultant who grew up in Wuhan, told me. \"A person's social standing was defined by the objects they own.\" Far from acting as a deterrent, high prices actually enticed customers who wanted to show off their new affluence; put another way, purchasing a good like a cup of coffee at a premium was a good way to obtain \"face\" in business or personal relationships. And Starbucks had the good fortune of entering the country at a time when coffee drinking became fashionable among hip, young Chinese consumers.\nThere are signs, however, that Chinese preferences for high-priced, imported goods may be waning. With the rise of e-commerce\u2014and more frequent foreign travel\u2014Chinese consumers have begun to feel that they're paying too much for simple pleasures like a cup of coffee. \"After living in America for awhile I was shocked at how expensive Starbucks was when I went back to China,\" says Wang. This trend appears to be happening across other industries, too: A disgruntled shopper told the Wall Street Journal's Laurie Burkitt that it simply wasn't \"worth shopping in China anymore.\"\nCould the Starbucks allure fade in China, as the country's once-non-existent coffee shop market matures? Probably not anytime soon. The company has proven adept at adding local touches in its Chinese stores, such as green tea flavored coffee drinks and collectible mugs, and has shown a flexibility that has eluded other foreign companies hoping to capitalize on the market. Eventually, though, Chinese customers may decide that a latte is just a latte\u2014and the no-name place down the street is more than good enough.",

    "user_prompt": "What are some of the specific issues that have arisen due to the influx of homeless people in the park near the Adult Recreation Center and what steps are being taken to prevent further incidents? Answer according to: Frigid overnight temperatures have led to an influx of homeless in the city, some of whom have been erecting tents and loitering at a park near the Adult Recreation Center, intimidating seniors who use the space to do tai chi, city officials said.\nIn one case, officials found one tent that had a microwave. Last weekend, some transients began fighting.\nMany of those who have been causing problems at Glendale Central Library or in the park are homeless people who don\u2019t use the emergency winter shelter at the National Guard Armory on Colorado Boulevard. Homeless outreach workers said at a City Hall meeting this week that they plan to stress the importance of respecting public property to shelter clients in hopes that they can influence their friends who may misbehave.\nOn cold nights, the shelter has been housing up to 100 people a night \u2014 above their 80-bed capacity \u2014 ahead of their March 1 closing date.\nAlfred Hernandez, an outreach worker, said he tries to take homeless people to an access center run by Ascencia, the nonprofit that also operates the shelter, after the armory closes for the day.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a constant battle,\u201d he said.\nSome homeless have been stuffing library toilets with paper products, messing with the plumbing, while others have left human waste outside a closed restroom by the Adult Recreation Center.\nThe reports were a sharp change from last month when city officials gave glowing reviews of homeless activities.\nDespite the park issues, Fire Capt. Jeff Ragusa said the homeless have not been a drain on fire resources like in the past.\n\u201cThis year is even less of an impact than last year,\u201d Ragusa said.\nLast year, the cities of Glendale and Burbank converted the National Guard Armory into a 50-bed shelter limited to homeless people referred by local nonprofits.\nOut of money this year, the cities gave up on their pilot project. In December, the shelter converted back to a county-funded, come one, come all, operation. Although the Los Angeles Homeless Service Authority has funded a 150-bed shelter at the armory in the past, the one Ascencia is running this year is limited to 80 beds.\nIan Costello, winter shelter program coordinator at Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, said Glendale\u2019s program is one of the best in the county.\n\u201cGlendale is doing a fantastic job,\u201d he said.\nMary Leasure, shelter program director, said her goal is to help shelter users transition into housing.\n\u201cThe sense of self-defeat can be very overwhelming,\u201d she said.\nDue to the National Guard\u2019s schedule, the final days of the three-month shelter, Feb 28 and March 1, are set to take place at a local church.",

As loyal customers for quite some time, we knew that we needed to save the farm and keep Brandywine\u2019s great local tradition going on uninterrupted.\nSo that\u2019s how a local doctor (Doc) and his wife of over 50 years (Nan) decided to take over a blueberry farm. We knew nothing about blueberry farming, and we only had 2 months to figure out how to be ready for the opening day of berry picking.\nFortunately, we were able to get some great tips on preparation; but the farm was still a task much bigger than we could handle on our own. That\u2019s where the help of the rest of our loving family comes in; our daughter-in-law Paula, daughter Deb, son John, grandkids, and great-grandkids would go on to make Rolla\u2019s best blueberry crew. They chipped in to help mowing, raking, painting, cleaning, sprucing, and sweating in the Missouri heat. With their help, we were able to open on the first week of June with a great harvest of sweet blueberries.\nThe Marti family is now four years into running the farm, and we are preparing for our fifth picking. We plan on expanding a bit in the future and we have already made several improvements over the last couple of years, such as our brand new irrigation system that helps us to fight off the unpredictable Missouri weather. Nan and Paula have also taken classes at a college in Springfield to better understand soil management, pH levels, and other things that continue to make Brandywine Farm blueberries the very best berries grown in the world.\nIf you aren\u2019t sure about that, make a trip to the Ozarks and find out for yourself. The good doc will be waiting to show you how to eat more berries than you put in your bucket.

    "user_prompt": "Summarize the importance of social media video production and the rise of live video, and explain the benefits it offers for brands. Answer according to: But why all the chatter?\nThe thing is, social media video production is huge right now and only getting bigger\u2014it\u2019s such a force, in fact, that here at Paton Internet Marketing we\u2019ve started our own service focused exclusively on the primacy of social video: Reality Social Media.\nWe\u2019re proud to make this announcement because we\u2019re so absolutely stoked about social media video production.\nAs of the second half of 2016, Snapchat was already experiencing in excess of 10 billion daily video views.\nDespite offering a greater variety of ways to consume information, as of March 2016 Facebook was already enjoying 8 billion daily video views.\nAnd Instagram? As of March 2016, Instagram was already experiencing approximately 15 million video uploads every single day.\nThese aren\u2019t just big numbers that have tailed off. For instance, from 2013-2014, Instagram video post frequency grew by 600%!\nThese are staggering numbers. If you don\u2019t have a social media video production strategy in place, you\u2019re screwing up!\nOf course, part of that strategy involves understanding the differences between the different varieties of social video.\nFor a long while, pre-recorded or \u201con-demand\u201d video was the norm, both in the social realm and otherwise. Users would select a video to watch when they wanted to watch it, and something that had already been \u201ctaped\u201d would play.\nNow, there is the rise of live video. Live social video is when a broadcaster chooses to live stream what they\u2019re currently engaged in. When a viewer tunes in, what they\u2019re seeing is happening that very moment, and once the live stream ends users often cannot call the video back up on-demand.\nFacebook and Instagram offer live video options. So does Snapchat. And Periscope is exclusively dedicated to the task.\nLive video launched into the stratosphere in 2016, with 81% of all internet audience members saying they watched more live video that year than in 2015. Additionally, 45% of all live video consumers now say they\u2019d be willing to pay for exclusive live video from their favorite personalities.\nIf these statistics don\u2019t convince you of the importance of keeping up with the changing world of social media video production, you should bear in mind the benefits live video offers, including greater brand exposure and creating a sense of urgency in your audience.\nBut Who\u2019s Watching All This?\n1. According to one survey, only 2% of those aged 13-33 report they\u2019re not on any social media platform.\n2. Teenagers today spend more time on social media than they do watching television. In fact, they\u2019re the first generation to dethrone TV as the most time-consuming daily activity. Further, traditional TV viewing by 18-24-year-olds plummeted by more than 9-and-a-half hours per week between 2011 and 2016.\nTellingly, most experts predict that by 2019, at least 74% of all the world\u2019s internet traffic will be video watchers!\nStudies also show that while only 20% of online audiences view written content, up to 80% are watching videos!\nEven renowned content marketer and social media specialist Neil Patel has waxed poetic on where social media video production is headed.\nLike the other major influencers in this space, at Paton we\u2019re fully aware of the kind of amazing return on investment (ROI) social video is primed to offer. That\u2019s why we\u2019re now offering our dedicated service exclusively focused on ensuring you get the most out of social video.\nGet started with Social Media Videos by going now to Paton Internet Marketing.",

Butter three 9-inch round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment, dust with flour and tap out the excess. Set aside.\nWhisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Whisk the buttermilk and cream of coconut in a small bowl. Beat the butter and 1 1/4 cups granulated sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Add the egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition, then beat in the vanilla and coconut extracts. Reduce the mixer speed to low; beat in the flour mixture in three batches, alternating with the buttermilk mixture, until combined.\nBeat the egg whites and the remaining 1/2 cup granulated sugar in a large bowl with clean beaters on medium-high speed until stiff glossy peaks form, 4 to 5 minutes. Using a rubber spatula, fold the egg whites into the batter in three batches until just combined (do not overmix). Divide the batter among the prepared pans and bake, switching the pans halfway through, until the cakes are lightly browned and the centers spring back when lightly pressed, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 20 minutes in the pans, then run a small knife around the edges of each cake and carefully invert onto the racks; remove the parchment and let cool completely.\nMeanwhile, make the frosting: Beat the butter and cream cheese in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until smooth, about 2 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to low and beat in about half of the confectioners' sugar until combined. Add the remaining confectioners' sugar, salt and vanilla and coconut extracts and beat until combined. Increase the mixer speed to medium high and continue beating, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes.\nPlace one cake layer on a cake stand or platter and top with a heaping 2/3 cup frosting. Add another cake layer, more frosting and the last cake layer. Cover the top and sides of the cake with the remaining frosting. Sprinkle the coconut all over the top and sides of the cake, gently pressing to adhere.\nThis cake gets its flavor from canned cream of coconut. Look for it with the drink mixers at your supermarket (don't use coconut milk or coconut cream).",

    "user_prompt": "Can you summarize the activities and events that occurred during the Step team's last day in Medell\u00edn and their arrival in Bogot\u00e1? Generate according to: Unfortunately then came to the last day in Medell\u00edn. We spent the morning shopping for presents for our host family so we could show our gratitude for staying there for 7 weeks. In the afternoon we took advantage of Medell\u00edn's many salons and went in for haircuts. When we returned we had a bit of emotional evening, sharing food, prayers, goodbyes and tears followed by a quick trip to the hospital for Jordan and Beth after their feet had swollen from mosquito bites. Miraculously, Beth and Jordan were seen quickly, given medicine for free and were back before we had even gone to bed! The following morning we rushed off to the airport, after having taken a little too long to get ready, to catch our flight to Bogot\u00e1. In Bogot\u00e1 we met others of the Latin Link team, Pipe, Paola, Fiona, Carmen and Strider Abi before heading off to Melgar for the Latin Link retreat. This was the first time that a Step team coincided with the Latin Link retreat days so we were very excited! We arrived at night, just in time for a midnight swim! It was such a blessing to have such a beautiful house for the retreat, a pool and being able to sleep on real beds! We woke up on a beautifully warm morning to a cooked breakfast by Graciela, the housekeeper. It was also Fiona's birthday and throughout the day we sang happy birthday in 6 different languages! Then followed by a devotional on John ch 20, a different passage to normal for considering mission. Abi talked about how God cares about us all individually and about every detail, and then we broke off into pairs and groups of three to pray deeply about the struggles we're going through personally. There was just enough time to have a dip in the pool before lunch in the afternoon. In the evening we had a brilliant cultural night, we played some classic English charades games, followed by some Swiss puzzles, then we learnt a dance to a Brazilian song, and then for the big finale Carmen, Diana and Pipe put on a show of Colombian dancing and some snacks for us all to try. Of course we finished the evening with another midnight swim, this time tied in with a new version of water polo before heading sleepily to bed. On the last day of the retreat we headed off for a prayer walk for Colombia. Then unfortunately it was time to say goodbye and head back to Bogot\u00e1. Me (Mel) and Alice ended up on a bus back to Abi\u2019s house alone and when we got to her house we waited for the others. Turned out they had already arrived and were waiting for us inside! Our plan was to head off to Villa de Leyva, our week off resting location that night but by the time we had all reassembled it was too late. We had a cosy night in Abi and Pipe's flat with some takeaway pizza- yum! We decided we'd go to Bogot\u00e1 salt cathedral and, since it was on the way to Villa de Leyva, we would head there afterwards. Unfortunately I twisted my ankle on the way down the stairs to the bus before we had even left the area where Abi and Pipe lived. However, we prayed and continued on with our day as it wasn't a serious sprain. The salt cathedral was a former salt mine which the miners had transformed into a cathedral with carvings and sculptures. Following the visit to the salt cathedral we walked to the main street to catch a bus in the direction of Villa de Leyva, after a confusing set of instructions from a bus driver we ended up taking 4 buses over 5 hours to reach our destination! But thank God that we finally reached our destination healthy and safe, if a bit tired! The next day we took the opportunity and had a lie in, something none of us had done in a while! We wondered around the colonial town of Villa de Leyva and enjoyed the cobbled streets and cute caf\u00e9s. We finished the afternoon by having some time to contact family and having a group devotional on relationships. Our next day was more action-packed, we went to see some nearby waterfalls starting off by zip-wiring into the valley! We wondered around the waterfalls and forest before having a picnic on the hilltop. Again for Arnoldo and Luz, who treated us like their own children and made us feel at home in their family. That my sprained ankle only caused me one day of pain and is basically now fully healed! That we were able to rest and have a good time on our week off. For the Latin Link team who were a pleasure to spend a weekend with and who have given us so much support physically and spiritually. For Eduardo, Manuel and Jacoba at our hostel who let us change our dates, drove us around and cooked for us. NB: I haven't done prayer requests as we're a little behind on the reports.",

    "user_prompt": "From echoing hallways and droning air conditioners to loud lectures and whispered secrets, schools can be noisy places. But a new study suggests high background noise can significantly distract some students during testing time.\nIn a new study in the journal Urban Education, University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, researchers Bo Zhang and Regina Navejar tracked 122 high school students' reactions to background noise in a large, high-poverty urban school district.\nUrban schools often face higher background noise\u2014with bigger class sizes, older concrete buildings that magnify sound, and sites closer to heavily traveled roads\u2014than suburban or rural schools. In more than 250 sound tests over two days, the researchers found the average noise level in the schools was 63.7 decibels and hit highs of 85 decibels, from hallway talking, door slamming, or even yelling in the classroom. None of the sound checks registered at or below 35 decibels, the recommended limit for classes.\nAbout 40 percent of the students reported that the noise level bothered them while taking a standardized math test. While two-thirds of all students said they were able to ignore the noise, one-third reported feeling angry, frustrated, or \"zoning out.\"\nThe researchers found that the more students reported being bothered by the sound, the lower their math scores. In fact, differences in reaction to the noise level accounted for 10 percent of the difference in students' scores on the math test. For context, that was the same magnitude of performance gap explained by the differences in students' prior grade point averages. The study found no difference in that effect for older or younger students.\n\"The amount of noise students in urban schools may be subjected to is astonishing,\" the researchers concluded. \"The lowest noise level recorded in this study is 55 [decibels] with the average almost doubling the recommended level, which happens to be very close to the critical 70 [decibels] recommended by some researchers as unfavorable for young learners. To exacerbate the situation, many students in this study have already lagged behind considerably in school work.\"\nThe results echo prior research, such as a 2013 study in the Journal of Urban Health, which found an increase in background noise of 10 decibels was associated with a drop of 5.5 points on average for 8- and 9-year-old students taking standardized tests in mathematics and French language, after controlling for their socioeconomic backgrounds.\nWhile school building standards have restricted building noises in the last decade, \"this study reveals most noise actually comes from inside the school, such as door slamming or yelling.\" The researchers recommended school administrators consider teaching students about noise pollution and reduction strategies, and using isolation headphones for students during testing. Based on the research, what recommendations do the researchers have for school administrators to help reduce the negative effects of background noise on student performance?",

    "user_prompt": "Given the text: First impressions are lasting ones, so getting your imagery right first time is essential. Human beings react with their eyes and their emotions first and foremost so if your photography is substandard and isn't evoking an exciting or awe-struck emotion, you most likely won't engage the attention of that visitor for more than a couple of seconds.\nIn this article, we will be going over 6 reasons why it is important, imperitive - crucial even - to have great product photography on your website.\n1) First impressions are immensely important.\nAs mentioned above a first impression is a lasting one, so if you don't create the 'wow' factor for your customers with your photography the first time they visit the website it is extremely likely that they won't return, which of course is the opposite to what anyone wants of their website.\nWhether you have a bricks and mortar shop or you are an online retailer, your website is basically your 'shop window' that is representative of you and your business. So having poor quality photography will reflect badly on your business and it may give the impression that you just aren't that bothered, which won't encourage customers to buy from or do business with you.\nAnyone that is contemplating spending their hard earned cash with you wants to know that you are professional and that you are a legitimate business, especially with so many scammers out there nowadays. So some of the very first things that people will look for, are things that indicate professionalism, such as great imagery.\nAsk yourself this - Would you buy something from a website if the pictures were poorly lit, badly edited or looked as though they were taken on an old camera phone? Would you trust that business?\nWould you take them seriously? I know I wouldn't! So it's essential that you give your customers the same peace of mind that you would expect when shopping online.\nWe can all be a bit dubious whilst shopping online, based on the fact that most of us have been deceived at some point by the way something looks online, only to receive it and find that it doesn't live up to expectations in person. High resolution product photos on your website ensure that your customers can get a really good look at what they're buying and gives them the next best thing to the see, touch and feel experience they would get in a physical shop.\nIt gives them the reassurance they need to feel safe ordering from you online, rather than going to a bigger retailer or shop elsewhere to find what they're looking for.\nRemember, people are impatient when shopping online. So ensure you have great product photography to catch and keep visitors attention and get them buying from you.\n5) Bad pictures can make your website look terrible!\nYou could spend \u00a340,000 on getting yourself a bespoke website made to spec but if the images that you put on there are low resolution, you risk making the website look cheap, unprofessional and generally ugly! On the other hand you can have a \u00a3400 website with amazing photography on it and it would make it look a million dollars. Photography really does make all the difference and can be the difference as to whether your website is a success or a flop!\nIn an ever disconnected and impersonal world, connecting to your customers emotion and providing an experience or outcome rather than just a product to buy can make all the difference. So rather than just going to visit the items in the back of your warehouse, taking a quick snap of them in poorly lit conditions with your ancient camera phone and a shaky hand, think about why someone would want to buy these items.\nYour website's product photography really is the difference between being successful online, and not.\nOver the coming weeks we will be following up from this blog article with a range of photography tips. So follow the blog on our website and our Facebook for more product photography tips, website tips and advice on selling online easily.\nDuring 2018 we also plan to launch a product photography classes showing you how to make the most out of your camera, and get great product photos. Watch this space!\nWhat are the consequences of having poor quality photography on your website?",

    "user_prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What is the best way to update drivers for video cards in Windows, particularly for the nVidia GeForce 7300 LE? Passage: My friend has a Dell XPS Desktop. The Original LCD Monitor That Came With The Computer Is Square and On The VGA Port. This weekend I added an Acer X193w LCD to the DVI Port. We mounted the Acer \"Portrait\" style and rotated the screen 90 degrees (using the orig windows drivers). we clicked on \"Update Driver\" in the Device Manager for Windows. the ability to have the 2nd monitor rotated \"Portrait\" style or 90 degrees is also gone. Please help... we are willing to sacrifice the resolution just to have the ability to rotate the screen 90 degrees again. and since \"Updating the driver\" that is no longer an option in the Display Manager. Windows Update Driver button is a bad idea. The lesson here is to not use that. So here's a recap of how I install drivers and MONITOR INF support files. 1. I use the maker's web page for the video card drivers. In your case, system restore back to when it worked as my bet is it's not the video card driver. 2. Many are taken aback when they learn about the MONITOR.INF support file (it's not a driver but for brevity let's call it a driver.) When we add a monitor the monitor's capability is in a monitor driver package and can be a simple (?) MONITOR.INF file. What If System Restore Is Not An Option? In reply to: Just sharing. Is There A Way To Get The Old nVidia Control Panel Back? The DVI Monitor (Acer 19\" Widescreen On The DVI Port) Is The One She Wants Rotated 90 Degrees (Portrait). Two Monitors attached at the same time in other words. Then you use the OLD FASHIONED mehtods. In reply to: What If System Restore Is Not An Option? Install the driver for the card in question manually. nvidia has an archive of such things, Dell might have them too. But many today need simple click here to fix it buttons but the industry isn't ready to offer such. In reply to: Then you use the OLD FASHIONED mehtods. Well that's what we thought the Device Manager Buttons labeled \"Update Driver\" and the \"Roll-Back Driver\" were! without them we would toil in fruitless downward spirals. I am going determine what video card is in that Dell XPS and then try to locate the \"factory\" driver for it. Then I will use that Acer Monitor.INF thingy you so generously told me about. Thanks for all the help, I'll be sure to let you know how it turns out. You can be sure I chastise them when I can and do my best to not put them off too much. The stories about drivers from Microsoft are now legendary and when a new 'softie tries to tell us that was the past the truth is its still here. In fact I brought up a specific incorrect driver from Windows Update on Windows 7 and was told \"well, that's just one so we're doing alright.\" There are plenty more so until the dust settles be prepared to update, install drivers the old fashioned way. The Vidio Card Turned Out To Be A nVidia GeForce 7300 LE. My friend did find the \"Rotate Display\" option. Anyway now everything is working to her satisfaction. but, in an effort to keep my friend from throwing her Dell out the window... I'm saving that for another day. You, me, Peabody, Sherman and a WABAC machine. For now and the foreseeable future, Windows drivers are best done the old fashioned way. It's better than Windows 3 days but not by much. The sure fire way to create trouble is to \"install the latest drivers\" on some machines. My advice is to not fix a working machine. Glad you got it working.",

    "user_prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Can business users reverse the trend of declining tablet sales?\n\nPassage: Can Business Users Reverse Tablet Sales Trends?\nMicrosoft&apos;s Surface Book. Image source: Microsoft.\nWhile tablet sales have steadily declined, there may be reason to believe they can recover.\nBusiness users and the growing popularity of 2-in-1 devices like Microsoft&apos;s Surface line may bring about a sales recovery, according to a new survey from J. Gold Associates. The research, which was first reported on by ComputerWorld, showed that the number of companies that will have over half their employees using tablets will grow by over 155% in the next three years.\nThat news comes at a time when Microsoft has not only expanded its Surface Pro line of tablets that also function as laptops, but launched Surface Book, a laptop that&apos;s also a tablet. Apple has also jumped into the hybrid market with its iPad Pro, its first tablet being sold with a company-created keyboard add-on offered.\nHow bad are tablet sales? After initially predicting a 3.8% year-over-year decline in tablet sales, International Data Corporation (IDC) has revised its 2015 prediction and now expects an 8% drop. That&apos;s a fairly dismal outlook for 2015, but the research company believes the market will return to growth in 2019 fueled by business customers using hybrid devices.\nIDC predicts that sales for 2-in-1s like the Surface, SurfaceBook, and iPad Pro (which it counts as tablets) will grow 86.5% year over year in 2015, with 14.7 million units shipped. That&apos;s still a tiny piece of the overall 212 million tablet market, but the numbers should pick up in years to come. That will be driven in part by falling prices and more companies entering the fray.\n\"With more OEMs offering devices in this segment, prices have started to come down significantly, said IDCs Ryan Reith in a press release. \"We estimate that over 40 different vendors shipped 2-in-1 products in the second quarter of 2015, which is up from just 14 vendors two years ago.\"\nThe hybrid market will also be helped by Apple getting involved and by Microsoft replacing the unpopular new-look Windows 8 with the more familiar Windows 10.\nBusiness will lead the wayBefore the launch of Surface in 2012, most tablets were marketed as consumption devices, not work platforms. The most successful of those, Apple&apos;s iPad, offered a lot of potential business uses, but it was presented to consumers as a platform for watching video, playing games, and other non-work uses.\nTablets&apos; ability to use productivity software like Microsoft Office was generally noted, but not pushed. Essentially, tablets were a fun-first category, and the ability to check email or view a spreadsheet was a secondary feature.\nSurface, then Surface Pro and SurfaceBook, now joined by iPad Pro (as well as countless hybrids made by other companies) effectively changed all of that. Now corporate customers appear to be catching up, and consumers are embracing the hybrids as productivity machines that can also be used for fun.\nIDC Tablets Research Director Jean Philippe Bouchard expects corporate adoption to accelerate. He said corporate IT departments will need time to evaluate Windows 10 and iPad Pro, but she expects 2-in-1s will take over some of the market share held by laptops and traditional tablets.\n\"So far, this category has been led by Microsoft with its Surface product line,\" he said. \"But with the arrival of the iPad Pro, the launch of Windows 10, which is better suited for the 2-in-1 form factor, and the introduction of Intel&apos;s Skylake silicon, we expect a flurry of new devices to launch between now and December 2015.\"\nIt just makes senseSurface and the other Windows 10 hybrids it inspired have steadily become viable alternatives to traditional laptops. Even the original model Surface RT, with all of its drawbacks, worked reasonably well in both its tablet and laptop modes.\nThe latest generation of hybrids, including Surface Pro 4, Surface Book, and iPad Pro, bridge that gap even further. You could argue that Surface Book is actually all the way there, and only its roughly $1,500 starting price is keeping it from gaining significant market share.\nGoing forward, there is no reason to believe the laptop mode of the 2-in-1s won&apos;t improve to make their usability equal to a stand-alone tablet or laptop. As prices fall, that will make corporate adoption of the devices essentially a two-for-one deal that makes no sense to pass up.\nIt will take time, and neither Apple nor Microsoft should expect a return to the days when tablets were a double-digit growth business, but business use of hybrids should eventually stop the sales decline.\nThe article Can Business Users Reverse Tablet Sales Trends? originally appeared on Fool.com.\nDaniel Kline owns shares of Apple and Microsoft.

I enjoyed my time as an associate doctor, but knew I wanted to run my own practice. I graduated school in 1997, and by 1999 I knew I wanted to go out on my own.\nI started my own business because I had a vision as to what I wanted to do with my business and the people I wanted to help and that was not being fulfilled as an associate doctor.\nThe cost to starting my own business was a challenge.\nI would look more into taking over an established practice for someone on the verge of retirement.\nThe personality trait that helps me the most is I am a laid back and very friendly person so I don\u2019t get overstressed. Sometimes being laid back may not be so helpful, but it\u2019s who I am.\nThe hardest part of the job is not getting too emotionally attached to your patients and their health. I want everyone to live an awesome, healthy life and I want everyone's outcome to be phenomenal. It gets frustrating when people do not follow through with their care program because I know if they did they would get even better results.\nThe easiest part is sitting down with someone during their revaluations going over their results and outcomes. We always prove our results with pre- and post-testing. I want people to feel great and at the same time they know their body is truly functioning better.\nThe biggest surprise is all the ups and downs you can go through running your own business.\nI would like to work with more people with overall wellness. I incorporated the wellness program into our office one and a half years ago. It\u2019s a phenomenal program making massive impact on the health of our patients. I want to help more people in this regard.\nPeople should come here because we do over-deliver for our patients.\nThe community is very friendly and it\u2019s a beautiful area. Colts Neck has that countryside feel yet it's so close the the Shore. It's very cool.\nBasically, I'm always in contact. The only way to not be in contact is to leave the country.\nI enjoy being with my son more than anything. He is the most important person in my life.\nHours: Chiropractic 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Mondays through Thursdays; Training room same as chiropractic as well as 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Fridays.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Can you provide a summary of Tom Gustafson's entrepreneurial journey and his vision for his business?",

    "user_prompt": "Given the text: When considering Lawson's draft stock, every scout says it starts with a healthy 2016 season. Unfortunately, after being a freshman All-American, he missed all of the 2014 season and half of 2015. Needless to say, a full and healthy junior campaign would go a long way to prove worthy of a first round selection. That is certainly a possibility considering the skillset he has displayed on the field.\nLawson has a tremendous combination of initial burst and power. He explodes off the snap which often puts opposing linemen off-balance from the start. He also has violent hands. When he sees his opponent punch he counters with heavy hands often succeeding in keeping him free. He gets low to turn the corner and is too strong for linemen to slow once he gets the edge on them. His handwork is very good, and he uses a variety of moves when rushing the passer.\nWe don't see him bull rush his opponents very often but in general, he converts speed to power very well. He may not have great long speed but in the box, he can seem like the most explosive player on the field. As a run defender, he uses those strong hands to stay free and separate from linemen. He also has a very good motor. The competitor in him really comes out when he doesn't get to the ball. He doesn't like to finish a play on the ground or with an opponent haven beaten him.\nThe one issue I consistently see that he has to address is there are snaps where he pops straight up. He has some success when playing with his hand off the ground because he is athletic enough to fake one direction, get the lineman to commit, and then counter. I think that is why he does occasionally play too high, but he negates his strength when he does so. It will also work far less in the NFL where his athleticism will not be as superior of that of his opposition.\nAlso, as powerful as he is I think he could get stronger in his lower half. When he is moving forward, his strength shines, but I don't see him, anchor, well when linemen really get their hands on him, or he is double-teamed. His future in the NFL is likely as a strong-side end, and the ability to hold his ground in those scenarios is essential. Still, the biggest area he can improve is to be on the field for a full season or two depending on when he chooses to enter the draft.\nCan you summarize the strengths and weaknesses of Lawson as a football player based on the text material?",

    "user_prompt": "Please summarize the author's experience at BBC Dallas hosted by the SITS girls and the sponsors who were present at the event. Answer according to: This past weekend I was so lucky as to get to go to BBC Dallas put on by the SITS girls! I had a wonderful time representing the RHOK and learned so much, I can't even write about it in one post!\nFirst, the sponsors Petit Jean Meats, Kings Hawaiian, Kroger, & Mirassou Winery just to name a few, were so kind and generous! They hosted lively parties and I found a new wine to love. Mirassou Moscato is absolutely devine and didn't break me out in hives. This is revolutionary, people. Most alcoholic beverages started breaking me out a couple of years ago! It's an evil, evil trick played by my body.\nAnyway, while that's really important and all- I did learn other things I need to pass along to my girls, and to our readers. So, I'm going to write about one or two subjects a time so as not to overload y'all.\nI got to meet so many people I only knew online. And others I am lucky to know now. This part alone was worth going! I really want to suggest that everyone find and plan to attend a blog conference. I had no idea what I was missing all this time. I also highly recommend joining the SITS girls community, ASAP.\nMe and @mamakatslosinit, a funny lady I've known on twitter for awhile, but got to meet IRL! She was a speaker.\nI was also lucky to \"know\" Tiffany Romero via twitter & she was instrumental in getting me to the conference so we could meet. Fran- the other lovely SITS lady is great too. SITS is such a great community & you can learn so much there. *Tiffany and Fran are the grand masterminds behind it all.* There were many great speakers and they covered a variety of topics...I am going to share, don't worry.\nBut first, my assignment for you now is to go to the SITS site, and learn all about it if you don't already know. Then next time I'll meet you back here for something a little meatier. Deal? Good.",

    "user_prompt": "Here is a piece of text: JOHN GUIDETTI has targeted a Europa League triumph with Celtic as part of a massive medal haul this season.\nThe Celtic striker is looking for Euro glory to put the gloss on a year with the Hoops he hopes will bag him loads of silverware.\nAnd, as he pondered the prospects for himself and the Premiership pacesetters this term, there was no inkling he is looking to leave Celtic Park when the campaign ends.\nThe Swedish star\u2019s loan from Manchester City expires next summer, but he insists he has plenty to prove between now and then.\nGuidetti had to sit out the early stages of the continental competition after he was registered too late, but he\u2019s available again when the action resumes in February against Inter Milan in the last 32 \u2013 and he can\u2019t wait for those clashes.\n\u201cThere are some fantastic teams in the tournament and it\u2019s a much more difficult competition than people may think,\u201d said Guidetti.\n\u201cThere are the likes of Liverpool and Napoli and my old club Feyenoord as well.\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be hard and we\u2019ll need a bit of luck, but the amazing support we have here at Celtic Park will be huge for us.\n\u201cWe know we have the chance to progress and the support will be right behind us.\nThe hitman, who has struck 11 goals in 13 starts for the league champions, also spoke about his goalscoring ambitions \u2013 and went some way to explaining his frustration over missed chances after kicking a post when another opportunity passed him by in last weekend\u2019s defeat of St Mirren.\n\u201cI love to play and score goals,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I\u2019m in the team, I want to do my best. When you\u2019ve the No 9 shirt, it\u2019s your job to score.\nJust as Craig Gordon treats every goal conceded as a personal insult, so every chance missed is viewed that way by Guidetti.\nAnd it\u2019s clear he is desperate to deliver for the Hoops support.\n\u201cFor me the fans made it easy to join Celtic,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a passionate guy and I like to get involved with the fans.\n\u201cWithout fans, football is nothing and we should be grateful to them.\n\u201cI just want to do my duty and try to help my team and the fans of the club reach the goals we all want to reach.\n\u201cEverybody knows that some days you have good days, some days you have bad days.\n\u201cBut hopefully we win more and, as long as you give 100 per cent and show you want it and care, it\u2019s not hard to deal with pressure.\n\u201cThe fans will accept it because that\u2019s what they want to see. It was great to win away at Aberdeen. It might sound strange, but sometimes it\u2019s nicer to win when you play badly and we didn\u2019t play a good game then.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a show of strength when you\u2019re not playing your best game and are a man down and still win the game.\nThe Hoops travel to face Dundee United in the Premiership on Sunday, with Guidetti eager to add to his goals tally.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: What teams will Celtic face in the Europa League, and how does Guidetti feel about their chances?",

    "user_prompt": "Easy cooking is my style, so I like to use programmable slow cookers to get those great meals. Any one with a busy life will appreciate the ease of set the timer and leave. I\u2019ve used slow cookers or crock pots for years. When I got a programmable one, I was in heaven. Meals got even easier. And healthier as well. I could make great food without all the pre-packaged items. You probably already know that I\u2019m a fan of the Cuisinart brand of small appliances. With all the choices available, I\u2019ve never been disappointed by any of my Cuisinart items. The same is true for my programmable slow cooker. I set the time that I want it to start, which setting I want, then walk away. If I forget about the slow cooker, no problem. Cuisinart did a great job of making this item. When my time setting has been it automatically switches to warm keeping my food ready until I\u2019m able to get back to it. I\u2019m careful to make sure that any of the small appliances I feature fit my criteria. A big one with slow cookers is the ease of cleaning. Each has to have a removable pot. Each programmable slow cooker that I feature here has that. Each also must have 3 temperature settings, at least. High and low settings are needed for most recipes, but I also want a warm setting. That helps when I can\u2019t watch the clock or be around when the timing is done. There are two basic sizes for slow cookers whether they are programmable or not. The small size is typically 3 1/2 quarts of capacity. This size is great for most of my cooking. It\u2019s perfect for 3-4 servings of one-dish meals and works great for 2-3 pound meats. The larger sizes range from 5 to 7 quart capacity. If you feed a large family, you\u2019ll need the bigger size. The largest sizes can easily provide you with up to 8 servings. These are also great when you are cooking for parties or bring-a-dish events. If you have the storage space, a programmable slow cooker in both sizes is ideal. You can use the smaller one for parts of meals, feeding just a few or preparing ingredients like beans. The larger one will be quite handy for those times when you need more space. Believe me, I\u2019ve used both of mine at the same time as well. Now that\u2019s handy. I\u2019d almost given up on my crock pot. I\u2019m seldom ready when it is\u2013there are no time guarantees in my day\u2013and I\u2019ve overcooked too many dishes into dryness or just plain mush. A programmable cooker is just what I need. Great idea! Can a programmable slow cooker save time and make cooking healthier?",

    "user_prompt": "When writing essays, it can sometimes be much easier if the professor has already chosen a topic for you. All you would have to do is start researching that topic and begin writing the essay. However, sometimes the professor will throw you a curve ball and make you pick your own topic. For someone who needs specific structure, or someone who does not do well with coming up with their own essay ideas, this can be problematic. The best way to approach this issue is to stay calm and think about the things you like and are passionate about. Think about topics that really get you going, something that you could take a few pages to argue about. And if that does not help, here are a few categories and topics that can help you get started.\nIs the death penalty justifiable?\nWill gun control keep crime down?\nIf your school has any policies that you wish they would remove or change, then make an argument and write about that.\nDoes a plus/minus grading system help of hinder students\u2019 GPA?\nShould students have to take classes that have nothing to do with their major?\nShould there be more or less cameras around campus?\nIs it fair that a lot of tuition costs go to the sports department?\nAbortion: Is it okay or not?\nThe legal drinking age: should it be raised or lowered?\nThe legal driving age; should it be raised or lowered?\nDoes media violence lead to violence in children?\nDo children use the internet to much?\nThese are only a few examples of the possible essay topics. But, the possibilities of topics are endless. If none of these topics work for you, then hopefully it will spark an idea of another topic.\nGenerate three additional essay topics related to education or campus life that could be added to the list.",

    "user_prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: Is there any indication of who may be selected as the new president of Myanmar, and how will this impact the country's future?\n\nPassage: Badges bearing portraits of Myanmar democracy icon Aung San Suu Kyi and the star and peacock symbol of her party, the National League for Democracy are seen for sale at the NLD headquarters in Yangon, March 8, 2016.\nMyanmar\u2019s parliament will begin picking a new president on Thursday as the nation continues its transition from a military dictatorship to a democratically elected government.\nWhile Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy won overwhelming victories in both houses of parliament in last year\u2019s elections, the Nobel Prize winner and chairman of the NLD is unlikely to take Myanmar\u2019s highest office.\nHer ascension to the presidency is blocked by a constitutional provision passed by the military junta in 2008 that bars people with close foreign relatives from taking the office. Since Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s late husband and two sons are British, NLD leaders have been scrambling to find a way to put her imprimatur on the top job.\nDiscussions between NLD officials and leaders of the armed forces over ways to modify the constitution or get around the provision apparently ground to a halt when the military refused to go along.\nWhile Aung San Suu Kyi may represent Myanmar\u2019s march to democracy, the military still holds a great amount of power in the country. One-fourth of the seats in parliament are reserved for the military, giving it a veto over a constitutional change and the ability to scuttle nearly any policy initiative.\nIn Myanmar, the president is selected from three vice-presidents selected by the parliament or Pyidaungsu Hluttaw. The Pyithu Hluttaw (lower house) and the Amyotha Hluttaw (upper house) and the military lawmakers separately elect a vice-presidential candidate.\nThe vice-presidential nominations are then vetted by the Presidential Electoral College Team comprised of the two parliament chairmen, two vice chairmen of parliament, representative members of parliament from both houses and one military member of parliament.\nA joint sitting of the entire parliament decides which of the three candidates will become the next president, That means it will take a few days before a president is selected. The two candidates who aren\u2019t selected as president become vice presidents.\n\u201cMarch 12 and 13 are the weekend, so confirmation of the president and vice-presidents cannot be made earlier than 14 March,\u201d U Ko Ko Naing director of the Pyidaungsu Hluttaw Office told Frontier Myanmar.\nNo matter who is picked, or what their status is with Aung San Suu Key, that person will be the first to lead a democratically elected government in Myanmar that is untainted by military ties since the 1962 coup that marked the start of authoritarian rule in the country.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the military in Myanmar is suddenly powerless. Not only does it control 25 percent of the parliament, but it also controls many key ministries giving it a big say in the way the country is run.\nReported by RFA's Myanmar Service. Translation by Khet Mar. Written in English by Brooks Boliek.\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the nature of the legal bar preventing Aung San Suu Kyi from becoming president.\nthe clause in the constitution that makes aung san suu kyi ineligible for the presidency was not \"pushed through by the military just before the election\". i was written into the constitution before it was approved in a dodgy referendum in 2008.",

    "user_prompt": "Given the text: The academic study of Educational Research is a division of social science research that applies to the various theoretical contexts underpinning pedagogy, with particular emphasis on the measurement and evaluation of educational data. The overriding objective of Educational Research is to advance the overall theoretical understanding of education as a concept and practice. As a research-centred discipline, Educational Research requires students to develop the advanced analytical and methodological skills needed efficiently to gather and evaluate relevant data; using these skills to apply theoretical knowledge practically in real-world teaching contexts. As a result, the importance of Educational Research is on a par with that of education itself, seeing as the former is the intellectual foundation of the latter; and, moreover, seeing as pedagogical practice is in a constant state of evolution and refinement. This means that the Educational Research student plays a vital role in helping to direct the overall course of teaching theory and practice. A first rate education system after all requires solid critical foundations: ensuring that long-term curricular plans follow an optimal strategic course. This entails proffering objectives, identifying challenges and outlining solutions to those challenges: this is particularly important in light of the vast complexity of the education system, which allows of numerous distinct methodological approaches. Educational Research consequently requires the ability for abstract thinking, for identifying innovative solutions to multifaceted problems. Furthermore, Educational Research necessarily pertains to policy-decisions and the governmental apparatuses that regulate the education system. A large part of Educational Research, then, has to do with taking a critical lens to existing policy and practice, determining their efficacy; isolating those components that are useful and those that are not, and offering suggestions for reform where necessary.\nDue to the data-driven nature of Educational Research, students need to be thoroughly familiar with a range of qualitative and quantitative methods, encompassing the diverse contexts that obtain in a heterogeneous field like education. This will likely include a multi-angular approach to the formal and informal aspects of education, which takes account of (among other things) classroom practice, pedagogy, evaluation, education management; touching on psychology, sociology, philosophy, cognitive theory and history. The Educational Research student, it follows, needs to be proficient in a broad range of specialties, being able to marshal insights from the various different fields to which education is subject, synthesising relevant data, and offering reasoned discussion of findings. As a researcher, one needs to be able to make a convincing argument for one's point of view, employing critical thinking and logical argument. One also needs to be a good communicator, rendering complex evidential findings intelligible to other scholars, but also to laypersons; for educators, policy makers and members of the public. Hence the Educational Research student will need to have a solid command of English, being able to translate complex data sets into clear and lucid prose. A first rate Educational Research student unites excellent research and communication skills in order to arrive at innovative solutions to the diverse challenges at play in teaching and the education system more generally.\nTo find out how Essay Writing Service UK can help you with your Educational Research essay, take a look at our essay writing page.

    "user_prompt": "Can you summarize the importance of building workplace morale and the role of fun team building activities in achieving this goal?: Office mates spend a great deal of time with one another, and building productive relationships in a professional setting is easier said than done. While productivity is obviously an overarching goal, offices and companies are filled with people at the end of the day. And balancing productivity with the more human side of building workplace morale is an ongoing task for human resource departments and managers. Finding time to break out of the office mold with fun team building activities is a particularly useful tool for reinforcing workplace bonds and strengthening relationships in the office. The variety of team building activities is surprisingly rich, so the team doesn\u2019t need to settle for outdated activities that lack imagination or creativity.\nCompanies have caught on to the ping pong craze, and a ping pong table in the break room has become a common site for many corporate offices. Office workers have found an affinity for stepping away from their desks in search of that ping pong-fueled respite, but what can be done to extend that natural bonding process outside of the office? That\u2019s where AceBounce comes in. Not only does this sprawling subterranean restaurant and bar in the heart of downtown Chicago offer ping pong (16 Butterfly ping pong tables in a nearly 15,000-square foot space) but they heighten the experience with food, beverage and games facilitators that will get every member of an office team involved in the fun. AceBounce has Games Gurus, who are really a hybrid of referee, commentator, master of ceremonies and rapid fire comic relief on the tables, and they organize and entertain group bookings around the ping pong tables. Instead of watching the two best players from the office face off while the other, less experienced players hang back and watch with nothing better to do, Games Gurus inject fun with innovative games that cater to all skill levels. At the end of the experience, an awards ceremony will take place with heaps of ribald commentary to go along with it. Share the ping pong love and move it beyond the bragging rights of a handful of diehard players so that everybody in the office can play along.\nWorking in an office can feel stodgy at times. The routine of a rush hour commute, a cascade of emails, humdrum fluorescent lighting and drab, utilitarian office decor can leave office workers yearning for more inspiring environs. A good way to break out of the routine trappings while doing some quality team building is to bring the team outside for a change of pace. Cruising around the city in a kayak is about as far away from the office as it gets. Seeing the city from the waterfront will give the team a much different perspective on where they work, while the camaraderie of paddling together to reach a destination has great reinforcing factors for workplace bonds. It\u2019s tough to imagine a more \u201cnatural\u201d team building activity that brings the work crew out of the office and into the refreshing surroundings of the outdoors.",

There\u2019s also a game machine with 200 classic games from the 1980s and 1990s, including Pac-Man.\nThe owners spent over $2 million to construct the game room, according to Senada Adzem, executive director of sales at Douglas Elliman Real Estate in Boca Raton, the listing agent for the home.\nThe estate, at 16141 Quiet Visa Circle, is in Stone Creek Ranch, a gated community off Lyons Road in unincorporated Palm Beach County. The community is particularly popular with high-level business executives because it offers privacy and security, as well as easy access to shopping, restaurants, entertainment and private schools, Adzem said.\n\u201cPeople feel like they can have the home of their dreams, but they\u2019re really secure,\u201d Adzem said. \u201cThey also like the fact that it\u2019s not a golf-course community.\u201dOther features of the estate include four bedrooms, five full and one half baths, an office, custom gym, wine room and living room with a floor-to-ceiling granite fireplace.

    "user_prompt": "Can you give me some advice on how to stay on track with my goals and overcome setbacks?: We\u2019re almost 6 weeks into 2017 it\u2019s a great time to check in to see how successful we\u2019ve been in keeping our New Year Resolutions. If you\u2019re like nearly 80% of us who make resolutions, then you this stat might shock you, that nearly that many fail by Super Bowl Sunday and that was last weekend. A staggering 5% of us will have succeeded in reaching our goals if at all. Why is that?\nThere are two reasons why we\u2019re so bad at reaching our goals: The first is that we bite off more than we can chew because we are eager for change, but lack a vision, a plan or clear goals. The second reason we fail to achieve success is that old habits die hard, and when there aren\u2019t simple rituals and disciplines in place, we tend to dance with the devil we already know instead of staying the course.\nA great question to ask yourself is: Are you really being productive or are you just busy? Often you get to the end of the day and think, \u201c Whoa I was busy all day, but what did I really accomplish and what do I have to show for being sooooo busy?\u201d Goals give us more than just a target to aim for, they help us change our behavior and create new habits. It\u2019s really easy to get off-course in life. Like airplanes, we constantly need to make course corrections to stay the path to arrive at our destination.\nWhat is your destination? ( your endgame/goal ) If you don\u2019t know, set one.\nHow can you minimize the pot holes or the turbulence in your life to get you to your destination?\nMost of us have tons of things we \u201chope\u201d to do, would \u201clike\u201d to do, \u201cshould\u201d do, but they aren\u2019t a MUST. If something isn\u2019t a MUST, it will never get done and there will always be an excuse. Fundamentally, there are two kinds of decisions you can make: intellectual decisions and emotional decisions. Once you understand these things on an emotional level, you are able to turn your shoulds into MUSTS. This is the pivotal point, this is the game changer, this is when you get leverage on yourself. This is when you\u2019re compelled to take action. A decision is not a real decision until it is a MUST for you, until you feel it on a cellular level, until and you are compelled to take action.\nIt\u2019s really easy to get off-course with our goals if we aren\u2019t careful. Like airplanes and road trips, we have to constantly make course corrections to stay on course. Once you have a vision and a destination, hustle, but wait \u2026 there\u2019s one last piece, you must decide to commit.\nThe moment you claim to be committed to something in your life, the universe will be sure to test that commitment so it can weed out the imposters. The question becomes, are you willing to take the hits again and again and slay the imposters to move into the land of ALL possibilities where YOUR dreams actually do come true? Are you willing to be knocked down over and over again, but continue to get back up, because you know that on the other side of the \u201ctesting ground\u201d is the EPIC life you\u2019ve been dreaming about.\nTRUTH TALK: That one final push that takes everything you\u2019ve got is to see just how dedicated you TRULY are\u2026 FYI this is where most people quit, don\u2019t be like everyone else. Each setback is actually a set up for your success; you\u2019re getting closer and closer to your dream. Take action and when the curveball comes your way, decide you are more committed to that epic dream then the safety of the known.",

    "user_prompt": "Here is a piece of text: Movie producer and longtime Hollywood insider Robert Cort has, in his first novel, created an engaging and authentic saga that encompasses the last 50 years of the film industry. Through three generations of Jastrows, a family whose dynamics resemble Shakespearean treachery mixed with Corleone allegiance, Cort chronicles the shift from the all-powerful studio system to today's all-powerful agent / star / profit-driven world.\nThe novel begins in 1948, when the 12-year-old AJ Jastrow's father, Harry, an honest and underappreciated executive at Paramount, dies of a heart attack. AJ's desire to fulfill his father's unrealized dreams, and the legacy of his father's integrity, permeate the entire story.\nDescribed in 10-year intervals, AJ's progress from adolescent to production chief to producer to creator of his own studio parallels the changing values of Hollywood. Important also is the book's depiction of how movies actually get made.\nIn his second decade, AJ breaks into Hollywood as an assistant to the legendary producer Mike Todd (Around the World in 80 Days). Cort seamlessly interweaves fictional characters and events with the real. Cort originally intended this as a work of nonfiction but later decided that the best way to convey truths about the film industry was to create fictional characters as well. In the course of the novel we encounter famous producers, agents and businessmen such as Ray Stark, Mike Ovitz, Robert Evans, Charles Bluhdorn and David Begelman and stars such as Bing Crosby, Richard Dreyfuss and Michael Douglas.\nAJ befriends an unknown Steve McQueen and later becomes his agent and best friend, only to have McQueen betray him once the actor becomes a big star. AJ's affair with the Austrian actress Romy Schneider helps sink his marriage, and a falling out with his mother, who becomes one of the wealthiest women in Hollywood, will eventually undo most of his life's work.\nIn the 1970s, AJ writes and produces a film about a company of American soldiers in Vietnam. While filming in Thailand, the wild and crazy director -- who bears a resemblance to Francis Ford Coppola -- creates such an unstable set that AJ suffers a heart attack. Comparisons to Apocalypse Now are not unintentional.\nIn the 1980s, a deal with Japanese investors disintegrates, and as AJ scrambles to save his fledging studio the unlikely success of a slasher movie (The Coney Island Maniac) comes to the rescue.\nWhat separates AJ Jastrow from most of his contemporaries, and what makes him sympathetic, is his moral compass. He's no saint, but he has a sense of right and wrong that informs his decision-making.\nThe story's climax revolves around the third generation of Jastrows, son Richard and daughter Jessica. Richard is a rapacious corporate executive who, because of deep-seated resentment, seeks to ruin his father's enterprise. Jessica remains her father's devoted assistant and confidante throughout.\nThe novel's final passages are surprising. Cort's work transcends the conventional to become truly moving.\n- Paul Moore reviewed this book for the Baltimore Sun, a Tribune Publishing newspaper.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: How does AJ Jastrow's relationship with Steve McQueen play out in the novel?",

    "user_prompt": "What are spheroid cultures, and what is their use in biological and ecotoxicological studies? How does the current study recommend the use of smaller spheroids to allow comparable oxygen concentrations to native tissues? Answer according to: A non-destructive technique which can measure the concentration and consumption of oxygen in 3D models of biological cells has been developed by Plymouth University in partnership with pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca.\nUsing Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) oximetry, scientists assessed the gradient of oxygen concentration within spheroids, 3D cell cultures typically used for testing the chemical toxicity within liver and tumour models.\nIt had previously been suggested that the centre of spheroid cultures becomes devoid of oxygen leading to cell death that may limit their use, but until now there has been no way of measuring the precise levels.\nWork by PhD researcher Laura Langan and Senior Research Fellow Dr Nicholas Dodd demonstrated smaller spheroids with a diameter of less than 120 micrometres (\u00b5m), and containing fewer than 2,500 cells, lose less than 12 per cent of their oxygen concentration after one week decreasing to less than 50 per cent two weeks after their creation.\nOverall, the study recommends the use of smaller spheroids to allow comparable oxygen concentrations to native tissues, with scientists believing the research provides further evidence of the appropriateness of these in vivo studies as a tool to elucidate fundamental biological processes in the spheroid systems and aid in the reduction of whole animal experiments.\nOver the past three decades, the use of three dimensional cell culture has gained increased recognition as an important tool in biological research and pre-clinical trials over conventional organs and animal models.\nSpheroids are one example of these, and are typically used to assess the chemical toxicity and evaluation of environmental samples in biological and ecotoxological studies.\nPlymouth University has previously perfected the technique of coaxing cells from the liver of rainbow trout and then manipulating them to form a three-dimensional spheroid.\nThis ball of cells behaves much more like normal animal tissue than cells grown in traditional ways in the lab and so can give researchers a more accurate picture of how an animal\u2019s body would respond to a chemical in the environment.\nThe current study is published in the PLOS ONE scientific journal, and the research team at Plymouth University has previously been awarded \u00a3600,000 by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC), the Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC) and AstraZeneca to work in this area.\nThe full paper \u2013 Direct Measurements of Oxygen Gradients in Spheroid Culture System using Electron Parametric Resonance Oxymetry by Langan, Dodd, Owen, Purcell, Jackson and Jha \u2013 is published in the PLOS ONE journal, doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0149492.\nThe School's strong and diverse research portfolio makes it a great place for research.\nNon-invasive pre-natal testing, new targets for cancer treatment, understanding macrophages, combating sepsis and self-disseminating vaccines.",

The company reported a full-year pretax loss of 2.4 billion Swiss franc, reflecting goodwill impairments (3.8 billion franc), restructuring costs (355 million franc), and litigation charges (821 million franc) for the full year.\nThe goodwill impairment is largely related to its 2000 acquisition of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ), an American investment bank.\nSpeaking to some of the challenges faced by investment banks in light of volatile markets, Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam noted that \"clearly the environment has deteriorated materially during the fourth quarter of 2015 and it is not clear when some of the current negative trends in financial markets and in the world economy may start to abate.\"\nNow what: The company's metrics were almost universally weaker than in the year-ago period. Tangible book value per share (which excludes the impact of goodwill impairments) declined 8%, assets under management dropped 11.3%, revenue fell 34%, and provisions for credit losses surged 77% year over year.\nCredit Suisse is overhauling its operations, moving away from investment banking and toward wealth management. It's also hoping to grow by getting smaller, identifying 4,000 positions that it plans to terminate to generate 1.2 billion franc in annual savings -- 34% of its 2018 goal. Investors are clearly worried that a turnaround will take longer than the bank suspects, selling off the stock in active trading today.",

    "user_prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What impact has the deteriorating financial market and world economy had on Credit Suisse's performance?\n\nPassage: The Swiss bank posted its first annual loss since the 2008 financial crisis.\nWhat: Shares of Credit Suisse Group AG (NYSE:CS) are plunging, down by more than 12% at 11:10 a.m. ET as the company reported disappointing earnings for 2015.\nSo what: Credit Suisse has been among the worst-performing banks in recent history, with shares plunging to prices not seen since 1991, according to Bloomberg. The company reported a full-year pretax loss of 2.4 billion Swiss franc, reflecting goodwill impairments (3.8 billion franc), restructuring costs (355 million franc), and litigation charges (821 million franc) for the full year.\nThe goodwill impairment is largely related to its 2000 acquisition of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ), an American investment bank.\nSpeaking to some of the challenges faced by investment banks in light of volatile markets, Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam noted that \"clearly the environment has deteriorated materially during the fourth quarter of 2015 and it is not clear when some of the current negative trends in financial markets and in the world economy may start to abate.\"\nNow what: The company's metrics were almost universally weaker than in the year-ago period. Tangible book value per share (which excludes the impact of goodwill impairments) declined 8%, assets under management dropped 11.3%, revenue fell 34%, and provisions for credit losses surged 77% year over year.\nCredit Suisse is overhauling its operations, moving away from investment banking and toward wealth management. It's also hoping to grow by getting smaller, identifying 4,000 positions that it plans to terminate to generate 1.2 billion franc in annual savings -- 34% of its 2018 goal. Investors are clearly worried that a turnaround will take longer than the bank suspects, selling off the stock in active trading today.",

The winter weather can be so harsh on our skin, causing it to become wind-chapped, cracked, and very dry.\nMy hands are usually most affected by the winter weather. They can become so rough and discolored from the lack of moisture. To combat this, I\u2019ve been using my sugar scrub and whipped body butter to keep my hands exfoliated and conditioned. This simple sugar scrub is made will all-natural ingredients to gently remove rough patches on the skin and improve circulation to keep the skin soft and supple.\nHere\u2019s a quick recipe to make your own sugar scrub!\nAdd all ingredients in a bowl.

To use, wet skin and apply sugar scrub. Rub scrub onto skin well to exfoliate skin. Rinse off. Enjoy your silky smooth skin!\nBe sure to use pure therapeutic grade essential oils. Some of my favorite ones are grapefruit, lavender, and lime. Looking for a blend?

    "user_prompt": "Can you suggest alternative types of squash that can be used in the healthy winter squash recipe?: For this healthy winter squash recipe, we roast grapes in a 450\u00b0F oven for a bit to intensify their flavor. We pair them here with kabocha squash, but butternut or acorn would also work. Serve alongside a green salad and roasted chicken for a hearty dinner.\nPlace grape clusters and thyme sprigs on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle with 2 tablespoons oil. Season with \u00bc teaspoon each kosher salt and pepper. Place squash on a second baking sheet. Drizzle with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil and season with the remaining \u00bc teaspoon each salt and pepper.\nRoast the grapes on the upper rack and squash on the lower rack. After 15 minutes, rotate the pans top to bottom and front to back and turn the squash pieces over. Continue roasting until the grapes are burst and are browning and the squash is golden and just tender, 6 to 10 minutes more for the grapes, 10 to 15 minutes more for the squash.\nSprinkle the squash with cheese. Return to the oven and roast until the cheese is melted and crispy on the edges, 5 to 7 minutes.\nScrape the squash and crispy cheese bits onto a serving platter and top with the grapes, the remaining 1 tablespoon thyme leaves and pepitas. Serve drizzled with vinegar, a sprinkle of Maldon salt and more pepper, if desired.\n1. Insert the tip of a large chef's knife straight down the center of the squash, starting right next to the top stem. Push the edge of the knife around the squash, rocking the knife a bit to cut completely through one side.\n2. Repeat this cut on the other side of the squash until the two halves come apart.\n3. Use a spoon to scrape out seeds and pulpy fibers.\nThis was excellent (although grapes seem unusual, the bits of sweetness work incredibly well with the squash) and everyone raved about it. No left overs! One word of warning - although the presentation looks nice with the grape twigs, I suggest removing the grapes from the twigs when you transfer the veggies to a serving platter. There are little stalks between the grapes and the twigs and those stalks tend to fall off and are not easily visible while eating, and they detract from the enjoyment. You can always use some of the sturdier twiggy bits as decoration, but avoid the stalks.",

    "user_prompt": "Given the text: What language / framework should a beginning coder use for a text-based game that will eventually be ported to twitter?\nI'm helping a friend prototype a single-player text-based game that'll eventually be played through twitter. He's a brilliant designer with limited coding experience, and he'd like to use this project to catch up on programming.\nThe prototype can run on any platform with a simple terminal interface (or simulated terminal, like a refreshing or ajax-based web page). The final game will use the twitter API to converse with players. It would be nice to be able to reuse code and experience between the two versions.\nIf I were coding it myself, I'd use CodeIgniter, since I'm familiar with PHP and MVC and all that stuff, and I'm sure I could find PHP libraries to talk to twitter. But PHP is an awful language, and even though I like CodeIgniter, I think it adds a lot of conceptual overhead and just plain busywork that would make it a pain for a beginner to use.\nRight now I'm considering python on the command line for the prototype, and some python-based app framework (any suggestions?) for the final. I don't actually know python, but hopefully I can keep a few steps ahead of my student!\nI'll probably recommend Coda as the (OSX) editor, since it's pretty friendly.\nAny comments on Komodo vs Coda as an editor/IDE for Python?\nYardbird is a Django based IRC bot. Django is more typically used as a CMS framework, but its here used to route and respond to IRC messages instead of HTTP requests. It could be adapted, but the tricky part would be getting it to speak to twitter rather than IRC.\nIf it were me, I'd probably use Pylons for something like this.\nFor an ORM, there's hardly anything better available in the world than SQLAlchemy, but it might be a little much for a beginner. Still, good habits start early, and hand-crafting your own SQL is a bad habit, along with annoying.\nTornado is a good framework for Python web applications.\nWe started in on Python, and it's working out well even though I'm learning it at the same time -- perhaps it's better that way.\nSounds like you're set, just wanted to add that your designer friend may find Processing interesting, especially if future projects are heavy on graphics or animation.\nFollowing up orangejenny's processing suggestion, Vormplus are just coming to the end of their processing month, which had been a good tutorial.\nWhat advantages are there to using Python for the prototype of the text-based game, according to the text material?",

    "user_prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How does TFSA usage vary by age group, and what is a pro tip for using TFSA in retirement?\n\nPassage: The long wait for a higher TFSA limit is finally over.\nYou\u2019ll be able to contribute up to $6,000 to a tax-free savings account in 2019, up from $5,500 in five of the six past years. The limit was set at $10,000 in 2015, then dialled back for the next year.\nThe 2019 limit was confirmed by the federal government in a list of adjustments to personal income tax and benefit amounts based on the latest inflation trend. Inflation has been low in recent years, but we\u2019ve now seen enough upward pressure on prices to trigger the higher TFSA limit.\nTo mark the occasion of a higher limit, let\u2019s look at smart and not so smart things people are doing with their TFSAs. The source of the numbers quoted here is Canada Revenue Agency\u2019s latest data, which are for the 2016 tax year.\nIn short, there is much more activity related to contributing to TFSAs than there is in withdrawing money.\nThe total value of contributions in 2016 was $54.8-billion, compared with $26.5-billion in withdrawals. A total of 113 million contributions were made in the year, compared with 19.5 million withdrawals. The average person made 14.5 contributions, and 4.8 withdrawals.\nPro tip: Keep up the great work. In a time of unprecedented acceptance of spending and borrowing, TFSAs have proven to be an effectively sticky way to get people to save or invest.\nIt is not a mistake to contribute less than the maximum. The mistake is to think you\u2019re failing if you can\u2019t get to the limit.\nThere was a lot of complaining when the TFSA limit was put back to $5,500 from $10,000 for 2016, but just 18 per cent of the total number of people who added money to a TFSA in 2016 maximized their contributions.\nThe cumulative total amount of TFSA contribution room available from the inaugural year of 2009 through 2016 was $46,500, yet the average fair market value for each individual who actually made a contribution was $17,286. The fair market value is a mix of contributions and gains from investment or savings. In 2016, the average unused TFSA contribution room was $27,653.\nPro tip: Contribute the most you can to your TFSA \u2013 up to the limit \u2013 while meeting all your other financial commitments. You can always catch up on unused TFSA room in future years.\nTFSA use rises as people age, and there\u2019s a notable acceleration at age 50 if you judge by the total dollar value of contributions. The biggest TFSA users are age 75 and older, though.\nTo start, this group has the most TFSA holders at 1.5 million and the most total TFSA accounts at 2.1 million. The average fair market value for each person was $32,111, close to double the national average as of 2016. The fair market value of all TFSAs held by this group was $49.2-billion, or 21 per cent of the total.\nPeople in the 75-plus cohort are very low-key with their TFSAs. Those who made contributions averaged 3.2 transactions for each person and those who took money out averaged just 2.5 withdrawals.\nPro tip: TFSAs are a great place to put money you must withdraw from a registered retirement income fund each year, but may not need to cover your living costs.\nYou have to be 18 to open a TFSA, an opportunity that many young people seem to be exploiting. There were 103,750 TFSA holders in 2016 who were under age 20, and the average value of TFSAs held by people age 20 and under was $2,998.\nPro tip: TFSAs are phenomenally useful for millennials as a place to save for near-term goals such as travel or home-buying, and for long-term goals such as retirement investing. Parents, you can gift your adult children money for their TFSAs without any tax consequences for you.\nWith 13.5 million TFSA holders in 2016 and 18.3 million TFSA accounts, the average number of accounts for each person was 1.4. But a substantial number of people had way more TFSAs than that. In fact, 51,640 people had five TFSAs and 3,090 people had 10 or more accounts. Why so many? Some people may be using TFSAs to try out different financial firms or banks, or to chase interest deals on high-interest savings accounts. The TFSA limit is the limit, regardless of how many accounts you have.\nPro tip: Nobody needs 10 TFSAs. Two or three, max. The fewer accounts you have, the easier it is to mind your fees, the investments inside your TFSA and the interest rates you\u2019re getting on savings. If consolidating TFSAs, consider a qualifying transfer (a direct transfer of your holdings) rather than making a withdrawal and then putting the money in another TFSA. There\u2019s a risk you\u2019ll exceed the annual TFSA contribution limit \u2013 triggering a penalty \u2013 if you withdraw money from a TFSA to immediately put into another account.",

    "user_prompt": "They say that \"the customer is always right\", as their patronage is what drives the profits and existence of a business. It is therefore imperative, that businesses ensure that they deliver high level of service to ensure that their customers keep coming back. However, in Ghana, most of us have gotten use to a poor and ineffective customer service culture. You are deemed lucky if you encounter a pleasant customer experience in Ghana. Endless ringing phone lines with no response and the mentality that staff are doing their customers a favour, are frustrations patrons deal with frequently. However, in the era of social media, disgruntled customers are increasingly using online platforms to share their experiences and hold businesses accountable. Just 140 characters on twitter can lead a business to face a PR disaster, impacting their revenue. It is therefore important that businesses use new and innovative ways to keep those customers satisfied and engaged. Technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) can revolutionize the way service is delivered to customers.\nAI is a wide area in computer science which requires software programmers to hand-engineer machines to learn cognitive functions such as problem solving and learning. Increasingly in our daily lives, AI is dramatically changing the way we carry out our task. With services such as Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa becoming more mainstream. Chatbots are software powered by AI to stimulate human conversations in real time. They allow customers to ask questions and voice their complaints, rather than calling a customer service agent or having to wait minutes for a live chat to respond. When developed properly, customers find it hard to tell if they are communicating with a human or an automated service agent. Messaging apps are increasingly becoming more popular, international businesses such as Google, KIA Motors and Bank of America have therefore adopted Chatbots to keep their customers satisfied and engaged. Rather than having to email or call a business, customers prefer to engage in interactive real-time conversations on platforms they actively use such as Facebook messenger. According to Forrester\u2019s H2 2016 Global Mobile Executive Online Survey, 49% of marketing executives have adopted Chatbots, in the last two years.\nChatbots can act as 24/7 automated customer service agents, assisting customers with their questions and complaints, no matter the time of day without fail. The constant engagement between customers and the business ultimately foster stronger brand loyalty and makes them perceive a business as more reliable. Chatbots also offer invaluable, insights into market trends and patterns derived from customers engagement with a business. The information gained ultimately allows businesses to gain market intelligence that can be utilized effectively to target audiences and create better marketing campaigns and promotions. The constant data Chatbots receives allows it to become smarter and know the customer better. This allows the Chatbot to recommend and send personalized and relevant business information straight to a customer\u2019s inbox. More importantly, Chatbots allow companies to gain access to the over 3 million Ghanaians on Facebook alone, allowing businesses to engage with existing customers and new potential ones on a scale that would be impossible to achieve manually.\nWhile the adoption rate of this technology is still picking up in Ghana, companies such as Mazzuma, a mobile money platform are already using AI in their business operations and services. Mazzuma\u2019s Chatbot developed by CYST, allows customers to send money, purchase airtime and purchase other utilities on Facebook messenger. Other companies in the country are also beginning to integrate Chatbots into their various services to generate leads, increase sales and help their businesses keep up with a growing customer base.\nQuality customer service is crucial to create a more effective business environment in Ghana. Especially in the in the era of social media and stiffer competition. It is therefore vital that, businesses prioritize their customer satisfaction to survive the test of time. It will only be a matter of time before AI technology and Chatbots becomes standard in business operations. Businesses should therefore consider adopting them, to remain relevant and competitive in the ever-growing digital world.\nAbout The Author: Fatima Tambajang is a project consultant, with a background in economics and business development. Fatima has worked across various industries and sectors throughout Europe and Africa, assisting businesses and organizations gain a comparative advantage by harnessing the power of disruptive technologies. How are chatbots helping businesses in Ghana in terms of customer engagement, market intelligence, and personalized recommendations?",

With that being said, you can seriously use any pasta.\nOften, I would prepare this exact meal with fettuccine, or saute a pound of ground beef, pour Classico\u00ae Red sauce over it, mix it with cooked pasta, add loads of cheese and bake for 15 minutes. The easiest and the yummiest dinner ever. The best part is, if you have \u201cany\u201d leftovers, pack it for work/school lunch the next day.\nCLASSICO\u00ae is passionate about using the finest ingredients and they are sharing tasty recipes on their website. So, now the team at Classico challenging you to \u201cmake it your own\u201d and share with them your tastiest recipes made of course with Classico\u2019s delicious sauces. The Mason jar is an important part of the rich heritage of the CLASSICO\u00ae brand as it helps to ensure each jar of sauce brings an authentic taste to your dinner table.\nBoil Tortellini according to package -Boil water, add a generous amount of salt and add Tortellini (or any other pasta). When Tortellini floats on the top, they are usually done, 4-5 minutes of boiling (you can always taste and see if they are done before draining).\nPreheat the oven at 400F (200C).\nIn the oven safe baking dish, add a few tablespoons of CLASSICO\u00ae Red Sauce -I used Fire roasted tomatoes and garlic. Spread equally on the bottom of the baking pan, then add cooked Tortellini.\nAdd more sauce, and slightly mix it to cover each piece.\nSprinkle cheese, just a bit, then gently mix to get the cheese all around Tortellini. Add the rest of the cheese on top, covering the Tortellini completely.\nPreheat the saute/frying pan with oil, add panko breadcrumbs and just lightly let them get toasted (About 2 minutes on medium high temperature). Add Italian Herb blend/seasoning and mix for just a few minutes.\nAdd toasted breadcrumbs on top of the cheese and bake the dish for about 15-20 minutes in the preheated oven.\nAs I said, you can use any pasta for this, even ravioli. You can add cooked chicken (Shredded/pulled apart leftovers work fine), Sauteed, lightly seasoned ground beef works fantastic with this. You can add steamed vegetables. I kept it simple, but ever so often I'd add blanched broccoli or spinach. You can use a microwave safe dish, and since everything is cooked, just heat it in the microwave for about 4-5 minutes, or until the cheese looks completely melted.",

We could run and jump and play games and do what we wanted to do with our bodies.\nThe maxim \u201cuse it or lose it\u201d was in operation though and over the years everyone\u2019s fitness changed and, generally, not for the better. Now when I look around at my peers it is painfully obvious who has been using it and who hasn\u2019t.\nFitness is simple\u2026move a load a distance. More fit equals moving larger loads further distances. Getting off the floor is moving a load a certain distance. Picking a box off the floor and putting it on a shelf is the same thing. How do you get more fit? Practice moving things faster and further. It really is that simple.\nYour health is closely tied to your fitness. We all marvel at the octogenarian who still moves and operates like she is fifty. And we all mourn when we see a fifty-year-old moving like he\u2019s eighty. The longer we live the bigger the gap we find between fit and unfit, between healthy and unhealthy.\nBeing fit takes commitment, work, and tenacity. You have to show up, grind out your work with intention and intensity, and realize that maintenance over the years is actually progress.\nBe fit. It beats the pants off of anything else.\nCan you provide some tips or strategies for improving fitness based on the text material?",

    "user_prompt": "Given the text: Creativity and innovation are often used interchangeably in conversation. But they really are two, completely different animals. Especially as it pertains to business.\nWhen you think creatively, it is as they say, outside of the box. Innovation on the other hand is the result of out-of-the-box thinking. The major difference between innovation and creativity is that creativity is manifesting ideas and potential concepts. Innovation is embracing those ideas and turning them into reality. One may feed off of the other: you cannot have innovation with creativity. You can, however have creativity without innovation.\nPeople who are creative may have ideas. Great ideas. Maybe they are different and stand out. But that creative idea is just an idea without an innovator. Innovators have passion. They are the driving force. Innovators are the farmers that tend to the seeds of an idea and make it grow. A creative idea without innovation is just a concept. You cannot let it sit and hope that someone else will make it a reality. It requires innovation. It requires you to make it happen.\nWalt Disney is regarded as both a creative thinker and innovator. His film Snow White was the first, feature-length, animated film ever. His classic started out as a creative idea. It was the seed of something that had never been done before. Innovation only happened when animators took pen to cell and actually gave the idea life.\nCreative leadership drives a business. Leaders take their creative ideas and introduce them to their team to lead them to innovation. Theses leaders give new perspectives to old ideas. They have an air of passion that can make the dullest work seem fresh and fun. They can also take failure, accept it, and learn from it.\nPay the creative people who can actually put ideas on paper and make things happen \u2013 Those are the valuable ones. Walt Disney knew this and surrounded himself with like-minded people. People who saw that the seed was there, and took it upon themselves to tend it and watch it bloom.\nHow did Walt Disney's success as an innovator and creative thinker rely on surrounding himself with like-minded individuals who were able to bring his ideas to life?",

A wide range of circus activities are depicted in this selection of over 100 photographs. These images illustrate the excitement as well as the hard work that went into putting on the show. Included are performers, clowns, animals, wagons, several posters and many behind-the-scenes shots.\nIn the United States, the circus as we know it began when Thomas Pool introduced the clown to his equestrian entertainment exhibit in Philadelphia in 1785. By the 1830s the traveling circus was developing into a major source of entertainment, especially for people in rural areas. The expansion of the railroads across the country led to the Golden Age of the Circus in the 1880s.\nIt was then that Wisconsin became a major player in the circus world. Not only did the world-famous Ringling Brothers get their start in Baraboo in 1875, they helped their cousins, the Gollmar Brothers, create their own circus there in 1891. Beginning in the 1870s, the George W. Hall family circuses made their home in Evansville.\nIn 1905 there were 100 traveling circus shows in the U.S. and their popularity continued to grow. Television drastically cut into the audience base during the 1950s, however, and today there are fewer than two dozen circuses operating in the U.S.",

    "user_prompt": "Space Cloud Computing - Emergent Space Technologies, Inc.\nPerforming complex analysis tasks in space is usually avoided with a preference to ground-based computing due to limited computing power of space-qualified processors, long verification and validation process of flight software, complexity of integrating with space hardware, and space communications bandwidth and connectivity challenges. However, with more spacecraft fleets and constellations entering the market and the evolution of small satellite technologies using faster CPUs, performing more analysis in space is becoming more feasible. To even further enable complex analysis tasks in space to meet needs for space situational awareness (SSA), intelligent and opportunistic sensing opportunities, artificial intelligence, or machine learning, the Space Cloud Computing (SCC) flight software (FSW) framework is being developed. Conceptually similar to public and private cloud computing platforms like Amazon EC2 and OpenStack, SCC provides a suite of services tailored for the space domain to expose compute, storage, sensors, and networking resources as services. While the concept of cloud computing matches, the implementation is quite different to address the resource constrained space environments and cyber security concerns.\nThe SCC project was designed to meet many mission objectives where your imagination is the only limitation. Early adopters will have small isolated networks that will meet a handful of specific tasks. An example could include a fleet of small satellites operating in near proximity with cross-link capabilities. Future missions would include collaboration of assets from different providers that enter and exit communications ranges and support discovery and registration of assets that augment the cloud. The SCC FSW framework is initially being developed to meet Air Force and DARPA mission objectives. It can also be leveraged to meet future NASA and commercial mission objectives, such as robotics exploration on the Moon and Mars or collaborative Earth and space science missions.

So perfect for the cold winters or hot summers. And it\u2019s a fast, last minute recipe. And this recipe is all about taste. You may have to play around with the measurements of the sauce to get the taste that you like. I\u2019m not a garlic person so I usually put less. 1. Cook noodles according to box directions. Use wheat noodles for a healthier choice. Drain then set aside. 2. In a small bowl, make the peanut sauce by adding the peanut butter, garlic, hoisin sauce and enough water to the right creamy consistency (not too runny). Taste it to make sure it\u2019s good to your taste. Set aside. 3. In a wok, put in about 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil. Heat the oil on medium heat then toss in snow peas and squash.

In celebration of this stories history, we present Spidey\u2019s spectacular step-by-step story!\nThe X-Men\u2019s Iceman clashed with Spider-Man in AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #92, but after realizing his mistake, joined forces with our hero to put the kibosh on Sam Bullit, a crooked politician wooing Gwen Stacy following the death of her father. Spidey stood alongside Earth\u2019s Mightiest Heroes at a charity event in AVENGERS #85, but when Gwen announced a permanent move to London in AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #93, he tried to drown his sorrows in a rematch with The Prowler.\nAfter a bout with The Beetle in AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #94, and making up his mind to fly to London to bring Gwen back, Peter Parker changed to his alter-ego in AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #95 to put down some British criminals. Back home again in CAPTAIN AMERICA #137, the Web-Slinger held off an attack by The Falcon, then teamed with the high-flying hero and Captain America versus Stone Face in CAPTAIN AMERICA #138.\nPeter took a job with Norman Osborn in AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #96, but the business tycoon allowed the pressures in his head to explode and reawaken his other self, The Green Goblin. He battled Spidey in AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #97, while unbeknownst to the two combatants, Norman\u2019s son and Peter\u2019s friend Harry fell under the spell of a drug dealer. The Wall Crawler crashed the pusher\u2019s party in AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #98, and made Norman see the light of reason by forcing him to face his son\u2019s pill problem.\nSpider-Man helped out Daredevil in a fracas with Namor the Sub-Mariner in DAREDEVIL #77, then broke up a prison riot in AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #99. Later, weary of his role as a super hero, Peter concocted a potion to be rid of his spider-powers in AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #100, but instead gave himself an extra four arms. Now sporting as many limbs as an actual spider, the young hero stumbled into the path of Morbius the Living Vampire in AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #101, and felt immense relief when his friend Dr. Curt Connors cured him of his multiple arms in AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #102.\nDesiring nothing more than a chance to get away from it all, Peter flew with Gwen and his boss J. Jonah Jameson to the Savage Land in search of a legendary monster in AMAZING SPIDER-MAN #103. When they found the creature, it took the timely intervention of Ka-Zar to unstick them from the web they\u2019d fallen into.",

    "user_prompt": "Live 9 brings a nice amount of new features to the table. And, surprisingly, there are a slew of new MIDI features that really polish the experience for those of us that love programming beats, melodies and so on.\nIn this article, I\u2019d like to go over some of these new MIDI editing features in the MIDI clip editor, and what they mean for programming MIDI in Ableton Live 9, and how they make life so much easier for us MIDI enthusiasts.\nOh, have I been excited by this one. In past versions Ableton Live, if you wanted to transpose MIDI notes within a MIDI clip, you had to actually go in a physically move the notes up and down the MIDI Note Editor keyboard range till you found the right key range for your melody.\nIn Ableton 9, we now have a Transpose slider that can be used to either transpose all the notes within a MIDI clip, or just individual notes. This may seem slight, but what it means is that you can quickly and easily set up several different transposed variations of bass lines, melodies, and more.\nThis makes it where, instead of copying multiple notes and moving groups up and down the keyboard range, you only have to adjust the slider, or type. You never even have to enter the MIDI Note Editor.\nAnd, either move the markers themselves, or hover, or click and hold between the markers and a pseudo-MIDI Stretch Marker will appear.\nMIDI Stretch Markers are a brilliant way to either edit MIDI, or to just warp the sequence of your selection to something completely different.\nDrag the Right MIDI Stretch Marker to the left, until you see the smaller 32nd notes appear. You\u2019ve almost instantly created a 32nd note shuffle within your 16th note sequence!\nThis dramatically speeds up what used to be a lot more tedious!\nThere are a lot more tricks that are right there in front of us, and just waiting to be found. But, hopefully these bring productivity and fun into your Live 9 experience!\nCan you explain the new MIDI editing features in Ableton Live 9 and how they make life easier for MIDI enthusiasts?",

Now, its oxidized, eerie beauty attracts explorers from distant points, including two from France on the day I ventured inside.\nThe United States is dotted with industrial remains dating back centuries. In Massachusetts, the circa-1600s Saugus Iron Works, called the birthplace of the American iron and steel industry, is a National Historic Site.

    "user_prompt": "Could you explain how Florence Welch's new album, \"How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful,\" reflects her changing approach to writing and expressing herself through her music? Answer according to: Breaking her foot mid-song at the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival in Indio in April was a painful but unexpectedly eye-opening experience for Florence Welch.\nHappily, she has recovered from her onstage Coachella mishap and is sitting no more.\nNow on tour in support of her fourth and most emotionally revealing album, the chart-topping \u201cHow Big, How Blue, How Beautiful,\u201d she and her band, The Machine, perform Wednesday at SDSU\u2019s Viejas Arena.\nWelch, 29, spoke with the Union-Tribune by phone from England about her proudly offbeat, baroque style of pop, getting older and quitting drinking. Here are excerpts from that conversation. To read the full interview, go to sandiegouniontribune.com.\nQ: Have you done more interviews in the past few years than you might ever care to recall?\nA: I\u2019ve done quite a few. It\u2019s funny, because I don\u2019t think musicians express themselves that well in conversation. We just write songs to best describe how we\u2019re feeling.\nQ: I\u2019d like to ask some questions you might not normally be asked. To begin, you go up to that great nightclub in the sky. Sitting at three tables are Billie Holiday, Etta James and Nina Simone. You can only sit down and talk with one of them. Who do you pick, and why?\nA: I think I\u2019d like to go sit next to Billie. I\u2019ve always been so fascinated by her and her voice. When I first became interested in music, the emotion and sadness behind her voice was always so captivating. I listened to it so much and was so drawn to it, and to her life and that whole era of music, of jazz.\nQ: Has it become more important for you to use your music to tell the truth about your life, as you do on your new album?\nA: I think very much so, yeah. And, as I get older, something in you (evolves). That holds especially true with this record. I don\u2019t know what (specific) drive in me came into play with it. I think I tried to write about my life on my previous albums. But, because of fear, I would hide behind metaphors and disappear behind fantasy, which was wonderful to use my imagination. But getting older meant the songs became much more direct and literal. And that was quite important to me, as an artist, to feel that was OK and to kind of own it and own who I was. It was almost like I had to own the bad and the good, equally, to kind of be more vulnerable.\nA: Hmm. I think it makes you - it\u2019s just a rite of passage, isn\u2019t it? You enter into the world of everyone else who\u2019s had their heart broken. It just gives you another level of understanding of the human condition. You can be more empathetic. But ... although it\u2019s happened so many times to countless people, when it happens to you, it\u2019s like you have to write songs about it. ... The only thing you can do when it happens to you is try to make something of it. It\u2019s very humbling.\nA: I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s all just experience. I think life, and really engaging in life, makes you a better songwriter. But, sometimes, I think being a musician is a perfect way not to engage in life, and (lets) you detach and live in a fantasy world.\nA: That\u2019s it! Sometimes, as a musician, the rate at which you grow is very much in your own hands, because you (can) stay like a child, forever. As long as you can go (perform a) show, the rest of your life can be total chaos. For me, having time alone and being responsible for myself when I was making this album showed me (what had been) my own self-destructive behavior.\nQ: How scary was it for you to remove some of the protective musical and emotional layers with your new album?\nA: It was frightening to release it because I felt very close to it. It\u2019s almost like (while) it helped me to make it, \u201cDo I have to tell people I feel better now?\u201d But something happens in the alchemy of a live performance. When you sing it to an audience and they sing it back, it\u2019s not yours anymore; it\u2019s a shared experience.\nQ: Prior to making \u201cHow Big,\u201d you said you\u2019d had a kind of \u201cnervous breakdown\u201d connected to your \u201con-off relationship\u201d with drinking. Was there a tipping point for you?\nA: I think the way that I grew up, going to parties and seeing punk bands play ... I grew up in very much of an art college, drinking culture, where - to perform - you\u2019d grab a bottle of vodka and a can of paint, and get onstage and see what happens. I thought the amount you drank would determine how good the gig was, and that\u2019s what I did, for years. It was this free-for-all, chaotic thing. And I don\u2019t regret it, because that\u2019s what it was.\nQ: What was it like to go onstage straight?",

    "user_prompt": "What are the market projections for spending on native advertising and RTB revenue, and how do the two intersect to benefit brand marketers? Answer according to: Two of the largest players in digital advertising are partnering to bring the industry something that many thought was impossible: native ads at scale.\nNative supply side platform Sharethrough and demand side platform AppNexus announced today that they will integrate their platforms to allow brand marketers to access billions of native ad impressions across hundreds of top publishers and apps via the Sharethrough Exchange.\nNow brands, trading desks and agencies will be able to purchase native ads through the same AppNexus workflow that they currently use for their display and video ad buys.\n\"AppNexus and Sharethrough will be the first to harness the scale and predictive attributes of programmatic technology in the service of powering compelling native advertising,\" said Brian O\u2019Kelley, CEO of AppNexus.\nThis integration was made possible by OpenRTB 2.3, the IAB's new specification for native programmatic advertising. The standard that makes it possible to trade metadata (headlines, descriptions and thumbnails) through advertising technology systems. Before OpenRTB 2.3, it was only possible to trade fixed sized files, which was not compatible with native advertising.\nIt's no surprise the two companies are making this happen, with the intersection of programmatic media buying and native advertising set for continued market growth. According to Business Insider, spending on native is expected to reach at least $21 billion in 2018 - with 15% of all online advertising budgets dedicated to native by 2020.\nMeanwhile, RTB revenue is estimated to reach almost $15 billion in 2016, according to eMarketer.\nThe combination of these two burgeoning advertising categories means brand marketers can now tell data-powered stories by blending the precision of programmatic with the content-first approach of native.",

    "user_prompt": "What are the challenges and opportunities in using computer databases to search the entire genome sequence of C. neoformans and related fungi, and how can this approach help to discover novel targets for treating fungal infections in immunocompromised patients, such as those caused by C. neoformans?\nGenerate according to: I study Cryptococcus neoformans, a common fungus found in the soil that is normally harmless to humans. If someone with a compromised immune system inhales it, however, the fungus causes an infection in the lungs. This infection is fatal if not treated, and treatment options are currently limited.\nIn order to establish an infection, C. neoformans needs to import copper and iron from its surroundings. Using computer databases to search the entire genome sequence of C. neoformans and related fungi, I hope to discover molecular pathways related to metal import.\nCopper starvation and excess response: C. neoformans needs a way to bring copper (and other metals) into the cell whenever the surroundings are low in copper concentration. They also need a way to sequester it if it is too high (too high a concentration is toxic). We are finishing a project started by Shannon Ellis to determine which genes and pathways are affected by copper excess and starvation.\nCopper regulation: The main protein that brings in copper is called Ctr4p. It is expressed in all subspecies of C. neoformans. However, the upstream DNA regions of Ctr4p in these different subspecies are not the same. We would like to figure out if the different subspecies use similar or different mechanisms to regulate the expression of this protein.\nWhole genome comparisons: In collaboration with Dr. Rich Kliman at Cedar Crest College, we are in the process of sequencing the entire genome of twelve strains of C. neoformans; four taken from clinical isolates and eight isolated from the environment. We are currently attempting to map phenotypic and expression differences to known regulator regions.",

    "user_prompt": "Start your marketing strategy with math. Marketing strategy isn\u2019t about a particular tactic or promotional effort, but rather it is a simple mathematical equation. Math in marketing is the crucial step towards having a successful marketing effort. There are three things to consider in your marketing plan to ensure success.\nThe first step in a solid marketing strategy is understanding your spend. Before you invest a dollar in marketing, understand what you have to get out of your marketing spend to create business value. It is not only about what you can afford to spend on marketing, in fact, I would suggest it is not about that at all. Marketing is meant to fuel your organization for growth, it is a way to create profit. Creating profit requires an investment, therefore your marketing should be considered a profit center.\nIf you haven\u2019t invested in marketing, or question what you are getting for your marketing spend, consider this: in the early stages of marketing, you may sacrifice your net profit margin to create larger overall net profit dollars being channeled back into your business. Identifying your marketing cost per acquisition (also referred to as MCPA or CPA), can help you to know whether your marketing is working or not. Your CPA creates a guiding principle on the maximum spend you are willing to accept to acquire a single customer and remain profitable.\nOften times companies start marketing their business and miss the step of understanding their spend and therefore either don\u2019t believe it is working or don\u2019t understand what they are getting for their spend. This creates the false sense that marketing doesn\u2019t work. Marketing does work, but ineffectively measuring outcomes could be disastrous.\nLet\u2019s say for example you have a marketing spend of $1000, and a target CPA of $100. You choose to invest your dollars (based on your personas \u2013 a persona is a composite sketch of your ideal customer, it helps to identify what channels your customers are likely to be looking for your product or service) in a direct mail campaign. You have a list purchase of $50, which then brings you to $950 in available dollars for your mailing. Each mailing costs you $1, for both printing of your post cards, letters, or other pieces as well as postage. You mail 950 pieces in the market and you get a response rate of 2% (creating 20 leads), your conversion rate (of lead to sale) is 60%. You have acquired 12 customers for your spend of $1000, bringing you a CPA of $83.33, well within your target of $100. In this example, this program works. Keep investing. The reality is when you begin testing marketing strategies you may not hit the mark on your target CPA out of the gate, but it doesn\u2019t mean with the right testing strategies that you won\u2019t get there. Most marketing channels can work for any business, measuring each channel is critical to getting results.\nMeasuring leading indicators like response rate or open rate are important, but at the end of the day measuring performance back to your CPA will determine whether or not it was successful.\nHaving a clear way to identify the effectiveness of each campaign back to your CPA target is critical to knowing whether your marketing efforts are succeeding. Relentlessly evaluate how you measure the effectiveness of your marketing efforts with persistence and consistency.\nEach marketing campaign (a campaign for the purpose of this article is a channel of distribution to reach your target audience) should have a clear way to measure its CPA impact. This methodology for investing can apply to all forms of marketing whether it is email marketing, pay per click, direct mail, SEO (search engine optimization) and so on. It creates a very clear picture of what is working for you and what needs additional refinement to create profit.\nMy philosophy on marketing is that if you can\u2019t measure it, don\u2019t do it. There are several platforms that will enable you to measure your effectiveness, Hubspot being one of them. Be diligent in understanding how you will measure each spend prior to starting.\nEverything you do in the early stages of a marketing effort should be considered a test. Consider employing A/B testing methodologies or the scientific method using a control to continuously refine and measure your results, only changing one variable at a time. Often times, I hear programs or initiatives didn\u2019t work. My belief is that most all things can work, it is a matter of testing the right changes to deliver results.\nSay for example in PPC (pay per click), if your clicks are low, perhaps you aren\u2019t targeting the right keywords or your call to action message is off. Each of these items should be tested independently. Next, perhaps your offer isn\u2019t compelling. If you are getting clicks with limited response, perhaps your landing page isn\u2019t strong enough or one variable of your landing page needs an adjustment to drive response. You get the idea, continuously test your efforts against a control, which means while you may not be getting the result you want, keep investing and testing until you do. Once you have identified a channel meeting your CPA target, that has been measured effectively, tested and iterated multiple times, invest as deeply as you can to acquire as much of that channel as you desire. You now have a winning marketing channel. This is what I refer to as performance marketing.\nPutting it all together. Begin with understanding your cost per acquisition. Identify channels that meet your personas in their likely media. Test relentlessly. Remember marketing is a math problem, not a strategy problem. How can you determine whether your marketing efforts are successful or not?",

    "user_prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: How do market experts advise investors to approach the current market conditions?\n\nPassage: U.S. stocks closed broadly higher on Wednesday after the midterm election results came in about as expected, lifting a cloud of uncertainty that was weighing on the market.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 545 points, led by gains in UnitedHealth and Apple. The S&P 500 gained 2.1 percent as the health care, tech and consumer discretionary sectors each rallied more than 2.8 percent. The Nasdaq Composite rose 2.6 percent.\nWednesday's post-midterms rally was larger than the average gain that follows the contests. Goldman Sachs noted the S&P 500 has averaged a gain of 0.7 percent from the day before the elections to the day after midterms. Wednesday marked the biggest post-midterms gain for both the Dow and S&P 500 since the day after the 1982 contests, when the indexes surged 4.3 percent and 3.9 percent, respectively.\n\"Hopefully we can all work together next year to continue delivering for the American people, including on economic growth, infrastructure, trade, lowering the cost of prescription drugs,\" Trump said in a news conference. \"The Democrats will come to us with a plan for infrastructure, a plan for healthcare, a plan for whatever they're looking at and we'll negotiate.\"\nDemocrats won control of the House of Representatives while Republicans retained their hold on the Senate, as the midterm's outcome split Congress.\n\"We believe (out of consensus) that a split Congress is the best outcome for US and global equity markets,\" said Marko Kolanovic, a widely followed quantitative analyst at J.P. Morgan, in a note. \"As the President cannot count on Congress or the Fed for more easing, he will need to do what is in his power to keep the economy rolling \u2013 drop the damaging trade war and turn it into a winning deal.\"\nInvestors expect Trump's business-friendly policies to continue, while some expressed optimism about Congress providing a larger check on Trump's more disruptive market actions. Historically, equity markets see strong returns when Congress is divided.\nStocks rallied across multiple sectors, as shares of Caterpillar, Goldman Sachs, Amazon and Alphabet all rose. Caterpillar is seen getting a boost from continued economic growth.\nThere's also some optimism the president will work with Democrats on an infrastructure plan. Vulcan Materials and United Rentals, jumped 4.5 percent and 0.9 percent, respectively.\nTech shares rose, as a divided Congress could also keep Trump from seriously going after giants like Amazon for being too big and influential on the economy.\n\"The pollsters were correct. The markets went into this, given [Tuesday's] close, expecting this outcome,\" said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \"Now the market is trying to figure out which sectors will do better.\"\nBut trade remains one area where Trump still has most control as tariffs are on foreign goods are implemented through the executive branch.\n\"A further ratcheting up of measures against China in January is still a risk,\" strategists at MRB Partners said in a note. \"Such an outcome would also add to upward pressure on U.S. inflation, while adding deflationary pressure to global goods prices.\"\nMeanwhile, the Federal Reserve is kicking off a two-day meeting on Wednesday. Worries around the pace of interest rate hikes last month saw global markets hit with sharp bouts of volatility. Markets have been pricing in a higher probability of the Fed raising rates again in December, with further tightening seen through 2019.\n\"I think they'll just say the data is good and they're still on the path toward normalization,\" said Anwiti Bahuguna, senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. \"They have the luxury of being data dependent because inflation and wage growth show no signs of the economy overheating.\"\nEquities in the U.S. closed higher on Tuesday as the elections began earlier in the day.\nDefense stocks are also among the expected winners from a divided Congress as it is one of the areas Democrats and Trump may find common ground. Democrats agreed to a Defense Department budget increase for fiscal year 2019.\nArt Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR, said financials could lose out as the Democrats take control of the House. \"In terms of the financials, they might need a bit more deregulation and that is harder to promote under a split Congress,\" he said.\nOverall, stocks typically do well when Congress is split and the White House is under Republican control. In those instances, the S&P 500 averages an annual return of 12 percent, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \"The best case scenario from here, in our view, might be gridlock: do nothing, and undo nothing,\" wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts and economists in a report leading up to the election.\nThese results could also lead to more investigations into Trump and therefore more stock market volatility.\nBut regardless of how the elections shake out, this is the best buying opportunity for investors before year-end, said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management.\n\"This is your entry point,\" he said, adding that positive seasonal factors, including strong holiday sales, should boost markets higher before the end of 2018. \"You might get some volatility in the next couple of days as the market absorbs the result, but you buy those dips. ... Everything is telling you this is the time to buy\" following the correction in October.\n\u2014CNBC's Ryan Browne , Tom Franck and Patti Domm contributed to this report.",

    "user_prompt": "Given the text: Do have a marketing plan? Strap in your ejection seat, and get ready for the rockets to fire. This will blast you into a marketing perspective that will challenge everything the Gurus sell you left and right every day. I attended a secret gathering of the biggest money makers in the world of multilevel marketing. The atmosphere was one of extremely high energy, and the whole crowd was literally abuzz. A company that began in 2008 is ready to make a big move on the world markets. There plan is simple (I tell you in a moment) and will enable them to have the same impact as Amway back in 1959. Amway, by the way, is short for American Way and began in Ada, Michigan. It\u2019s founders were Jay Van Andel and Rich DeVos. They had one product \u2013 Liquid Organic Cleaner \u2013 one of the world\u2019s first bio-degradable, concentrated multi-purpose cleaners. No matter what you think, Amway is not and never has been anything close to a pyramid. Basically, their plan was to start by selling products literally everyone uses. In 1959, soap was it. They offered a high grade, concentrated soap, at market compatible prices, and people wanted it and loved it. Why do I tell you this? Because it is the same approach that the owners of this 21st-century company used to launch their company in 2008. In just 5 years, this company has got a foothold in 36 countries with the approval of the governments of each country. They sell a product that 80% of the world loves to have. Holton Buggs, one of the founders, says it is what Warren Buffet advises. Essentially, things you like to do should be your hobbies, and things the world loves is what should be your business. That\u2019s more of a paraphrase than a direct quote. So what is the product? Some of you likely guessed \u2013 it\u2019s coffee! It\u2019s not just coffee, it is premium, gourmet coffee. The market for premium coffee is growing rapidly, and we can thank Starbucks for that. Starbucks made it acceptable to pay 5 bucks for a cup of coffee. And what Bernardo Chua, and Shane Morrand decided to do was leverage a market that is the second highest volume on the world\u2019s commodities markets \u2013 second only to oil. When they found they could combine one of the healthiest herbs in history with coffee, and literally make coffee uniquely healthy without changing its flavor\u2026 well, it made history for the Coffee world. So why did they wait until 2014 to bring all the big marketers together in a secret gathering? Because they had to prove they could make the company grow. They literally created the multilevel marketing worlds top money earners and turned totally inexperienced people into highly successful people. They now had the proof. I was very excited to be at this secret gathering and skeptical about whether it was just buzz. But after tasting, and reviewing everything about the products and people post \u201csecret meeting,\u201d I found that nothing was hype, nothing was just buzz. Organo Gold was where I needed to be, because the product is second to none, and the opportunity has only begun to grow. So now I am part of a team of multilevel marketing top producers and I am inviting you to join in with me because it literally has the easiest marketing plan ever. That\u2019s it, and it works. Anyone that can ask anyone you meet these four questions will have their first customers in days. There is no way around it. Organo Gold \u2013 The coffee that pays!

    "user_prompt": "Here is a piece of text: Now that Sabrina Bengel and Dana Outlaw have each revealed flaws in the other\ufffds campaign finance reporting, it\ufffds time they move on and focus on what New Bern voters really want to know: Who between them is most fit to lead the Board of Aldermen and the city of New Bern starting in December?\nJust so you know we know, elections have a way of bringing out the worst people, and as we head into the Nov. 5 runoff, that seems to be evident in this case.\nAfter the first campaign spending reports were publicized, Outlaw wasted no time taking a dig at Bengel, who appeared to spend nine times what Outlaw spent in the primary. To punctuate the point, Outlaw called for nine debates leading up to the runoff election.\nNot to be outdone, Bengel\ufffds campaign pointed out a complaint they filed in September about Outlaw\ufffds spending reports. That led to Outlaw amending his reports to correct errors and omissions. Then Outlaw fired off a message of his own, pointing out errors and omissions in Bengel\ufffds report.\nBut in amending his report, Outlaw revealed additional spending, about four times more spending than he had previously reported. So we asked him on Friday when he stopped by the newsroom, did he plan to relax his call for nine debates? Since it now appears evident that Bengel only outspent Outlaw by about four times leading up to the October election.\nOutlaw didn\ufffdt answer the question, which is not unusual.\nOutlaw has demonstrated an occasional inability to answer questions directly, such as some of those asked at the mayoral forum the Sun Journal and the Chamber of Commerce sponsored a few weeks ago. For example, when someone asked him how he would make New Bern a more attractive place for young people to stay or move to, Outlaw responded that it was the quality of the roads between Camp Lejeune and Cherry Point Marine air station that would make a difference.\nBengel, on the other hand, has hired Madison Avenue professionals to help advise her campaign, which leads us to wonder, who is speaking about the vision for New Bern, Bengel or her Madison Avenue advisers?\nTime is running out, but there are a few opportunities to educate the voters.\nDebates are about to start with the first one taking place Monday from noon to 2 p.m. in the Isaac Taylor Garden at 228 Craven St., sponsored by New Bern Now.\nA second debate has been set for from 6-8 p.m. Wednesday at The Flame at 2301 Neuse Blvd. and is hosted by New Bern\ufffds African American Leadership groups.\nA third debate is Oct. 29, hosted by the New Bern Chamber of Commerce, is from 7-8:30 p.m. at Orringer Auditorium on the campus of Craven Community College off of South Glenburnie Road.\nWe urge undecided voters to attend these debates and demand Bengel and Outlaw explain why they are best suited to be mayor.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: What are some potential areas of focus for the mayoral candidates to address during debates and in their visions for New Bern's future, based on the concerns raised by voters and the community?",

Sport Ireland provides a range of education materials and programmes, which the NGB is responsible for making available to their membership to increase awareness of the anti-doping rules.\nAthletes and their support personnel often say they are not sure where to start learning about anti-doping. There is alot of information available about anti-doping, but a good place to start is to work through the various sections on this website to increase your knowledge of anti-doping, and check what leaflets or programmes would be useful to you.\nAthletes who compete at international level competition should pay particular attention to section 1 of the Therapeutic Use Exemptions Policy where some International Federations require athletes to apply directly to them for a TUE.\nParents, Coaches, Team Doctors, G.P.s, Officials, Physiotherapists etc all play a role in ensuring their sport is drug-free, hence it is important that these groups also engage with, and learn about, the anti-doping rules in the same manner that an athlete would.",

In The Economic Effects of Borrower Bailout: Evidence from an Emerging Market, the researchers examine how the fallout of the Agricultural Debt Waiver and Debt Relief Scheme (ADWDRS), that unconditionally waived (either partly or fully) the debts of nearly 60 million rural households\u2014totalling almost $17 billion\u2014varied widely from the potential outcomes its proponents had trumpeted.\nSupporters of the waiver had said that farmers, with the yoke of repaying debts with farm income gone, would put surpluses into their farm-holdings, thus driving up agricultural productivity, rural consumption and wages. The researchers found that nothing of the sort happened. Instead, a moral hazard was created with borrowers in good-standing till then perceiving that defaults did not carry any negative consequences. Also, the waiver made borrowers prone to anticipating similar bailouts as possible pre-election sops\u2014ADWDRS came right before the 2009 general elections. Another significant impact was that it distorted priority-sector lending aimed at the farm sector on the ground. It led to moving away of bank credit allocation from districts which had benefited the most to districts that had seen comparatively lower incidences of default\u2014as per the World Bank study, the districts that received above-median bailout funds saw only $0.36 of new lending per dollar of loan waived while those that received below-median sums got $4 of new lending per dollar of loan waived.",

PS3 owners are still waiting for a solid PS3 release time for the FIFA 12 demo, and although the demo is also out on PC, we\u2019ve been hearing that one or two of you may be having problems installing it.\nFirstly, if you are still looking for the FIFA 12 demo download for PC, you can find the link to it over at Fileplanet here. The demo weighs in at 1.5GB which isn\u2019t a problem but you may want to uninstall any copy of FIFA 11 that you may still have on your system.\nA report we\u2019ve read over at PCGames.de has stated that users may have problems installing the FIFA 12 demo if FIFA 11 is installed on your PC. Uninstalling FIFA 11 is proving to be a temporary solution for those who have tried this, but we\u2019re still hearing that some of you are having problems getting the demo to run afterwards. The good thing to note here, is that this appears to be an isolated issue which is only affecting a small amount of PC users \u2013 so not everyone.\nAnother problem which we have read about is the issues encountered with the demo whenever one or more gamepads are connected to the PC whilst the demo is running. If you have experienced this problem or any installation problems like the one listed above, get in touch with us below.\nThe PS3 demo looks to be arriving at any moment, so it is worth checking the PS Store constantly to see if it\u2019s up yet. Whispers on the internet are suggesting that it is already available for US gamers, while those of you in the UK will receive it around 5pm.\nHave you had any problems with the FIFA 12 demo or not?\nI am having th PC pad problem. The game just craches at the start screen, if I have a pad plugged in before the game starts.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Are there any known issues with gamepads causing the FIFA 12 demo to crash, and if so, what can be done to resolve the problem?",

Use the trainer copter to practice your piloting skills. Your main objective is to get the copter off the ground,stabilize a hover, and get used to the throttle's sensitivity. Don't try to do anything fancy at first, just minor adjustments. Once you have the throttle controls down, you can work on yaw, pitch, and roll. If the copter keeps drifting in a certain direction without any controls being touched, adjust the trim by sliding the black switches on the sides of the sticks. Little bars on the sides of the Home Screen will show you the current trim settings. Highly accurate potentiometers cost a lot and can degrade or drift over time. Transmitters utilize trim switches because it's much cheaper to build a transmitter with low-cost, inaccurate stick potentiometers and use trim adjustments to dial the potentiometers in. Explore the other settings. You can tune and adjust many other things.\nHow do I bind the transmitter to the quadcopter, and what should I do if the copter starts spinning at full throttle during calibration?",

    "user_prompt": "Here is a piece of text: Internet stocks retreat for the second day in a row, but Yahoo soars in after-hours trading after reporting its earnings.\nShares of Internet companies jumped in after-hours trading today after Yahoo solidly beat Wall Street estimates with its second-quarter earnings and announced a 2-for-1 stock split.\nStock trading in the Internet directory company were halted, but competitor Lycos traded at 82-1/2 up from 77-1/2, according to brokerage firm Instinet. Amazon.com traded on Instinet at 113, up from 107-1/8 at the close.\nYahoo shares soared once released from the Nasdaq halt in the after-hours market, trading at 202, up from 186-3/16 at the close.\nInternet issues had retreated for the second day in a row hours before Yahoo--considered an Internet bellwether--was to report earnings for its second quarter.\nThe rundown was led by online bookseller Amazon.com, which finished the day down 12.28 percent at 107.125. Earlier in the day, NationsBanc Montgomery Securities analyst Steve Horen said he downgraded the stock to \"hold\" from \"buy\" because he believes Amazon's current price is too high.\nOther Internet commerce firms also declined today, including music sellers CDNow, which was down 12.67 percent at 20.25 and N2K, which was down 5.88 percent at 21. Online computer and software retailer Egghead was off 1.61 percent at 15.25.\nSearch engine companies also slipped, with Excite dropping just over 5 percent to 91.375 and Infoseek, down 2.3 percent at 34.5.\nEven Inktomi, which has soared more than 90 percent during the last week, retreated today. Shares in the company were down nearly 4 percent at 73.5.\nAndrea Williams, an analyst at Volpe Brown Whelan, attributed most of the declines in Internet stocks to profit-taking, noting the strong run-up during the last two weeks. She added that Internet investors are particularly focused on Yahoo's earnings report, released at the close of the market today.\nIn the past, Yahoo's earnings reports, which come out earlier than those of most other Net companies, have triggered sharp run-ups in the sector. It was unclear, however, if today's report would have the same effect, given the recent rallies, Williams added.\n\"It's not clear how much of [Yahoo's] anticipated strong earnings have been incorporated into the stock prices\" of Internet companies already, she explained. \"These stocks recently have been trading more on psychological momentum, so it isn't clear whether the stock will rally again or in fact whether they'll sell off once investors are presented with clear fundamental data.\"\nIt also was unclear whether Yahoo's earnings will be enough to justify the company's current market capitalization, estimated to stand at about $9 billion--or about 40 times its estimated 1999 revenues.\n\"Whatever number above [the expected] 9 cents [per share] they might report, it won't be proof that Yahoo has earned the market cap they currently have,\" Williams said.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Can you provide an analysis of the reasons behind the recent declines in internet stocks and what factors are contributing to the volatility in the market?",

So I\u2019ve got no problems with them booing and saying things they\u2019ve been saying because it\u2019s all true.\nToday\u2019s fixture at Fratton Park is an immediate chance for Luton\u2019s players to put right Saturday\u2019s wrong and Mackail-Smith believe the swift turnaround could possibly work in Hatters\u2019 favour.\nHe added: \u201cI think in a good sense we\u2019ve got a game very, very quickly so we can get round each other and put things right.\n\u201cWe got a positive result against Exeter and we can try and get another positive result away from home.",

    "user_prompt": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia \u2014 The search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 shifted to another section of the southern Indian Ocean on Friday after new analysis by investigators indicated that the aircraft was traveling faster than previously thought.\nThe new search area is 680 miles northeast of where planes and ships have been scouring the waters for any sign of the plane. It is also four times as large as where the search team was looking Thursday, expanding the area being covered from 48,500 square miles to 198,200 square miles, according to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA).\nThe new lead comes from analysis of radar data between the South China Sea and the Strait of Malacca before radar contact was lost, AMSA said. Those data show that the aircraft traveled at a higher speed than investigators thought, therefore used more fuel and possibly traveled less far south, according to the Australians.\nAustralian officials said the new lead was based on continued analysis of information pieced together from radar and satellite data, as observers try to find the plane, which had 239 people on board when it strayed far from its intended path to Beijing on March 8.\nThe Australian-led search has spent several days trying to track down debris picked up by various satellites, which have offered the strongest leads in the hunt for the plane. But so far, observers on low-flying planes and on ships have come up short.\nOn Monday, a Thai satellite spotted at least 300 floating objects in the southern Indian Ocean, where authorities say the plane went down almost three weeks ago, a Thai official said Thursday.\n1,600 miles southwest of Perth, Australia, said Anond Snidvongs, executive director of the agency.\n100 objects earlier in the week.\nAlthough the satellite images are inconclusive, they should allow air- and sea-based crews to refine their attempts to locate remnants of the missing plane or its cargo, experts said.\n\u201cThe floating debris combined with the satellite data are a powerful combination,\u201d said Dave Gallo, who searched the ocean bottom for the black box, or flight recorder, of an Air France flight that went down in the southern Atlantic in 2009.\n\u201cThat gives them the center of the haystack. Track record shows that an aircraft will be very close to that last known position,\u201d he said.\nAircraft and ships from six countries \u2014 Australia, New Zealand, the United States, Japan, China and South Korea \u2014 have been trying to cover a nearly 50,000-square-mile search area, a region so far from their base in Perth that planes have enough fuel to search for only two to four hours before turning back.\nBetween bad weather and the unpredictable interplay of wind and ocean currents, observers have run into a series of dead ends.\nWednesday\u2019s search area, for example, included the location where a French satellite detected signs of 122 objects. Observers saw three items in the area late in the day: two that were likely rope plus a blue object. When planes flew overhead again to take a look, they could not spot them.\nEven finding debris that comes from the missing flight is just a first step in unraveling the mystery of what happened to it, Gallo said.\nThe black box containing cockpit audio and flight data must still be found, and at this point any plane debris may have drifted 10 to 100 miles from the spot of the possible crash site.\nIn addition to leading the team from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution that found the Air France black box in the Atlantic, Gallo took part in mapping the ocean floor near the current search area.\nThe underwater terrain there is known as the Southeast Indian Ridge, a portion of an underwater mountain chain known as the Mid-Ocean Ridge.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a 50,000-mile-long mountain range that wraps around the Earth like the seams of a baseball,\u201d Gallo said of the Mid-Ocean Ridge.\nHe said the ocean bottom was rolling mountains, more like the Appalachians than the Rockies, with depths from 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 miles.\nThe search could be running short of time.\n39 years before becoming a professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona.\nThe additional equipment includes a device that can be towed underwater to listen for a \u201cping\u201d from the plane\u2019s black box and an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) akin to an unmanned submarine.\nThe towed ping locator (TPL) is mounted on a sled on a long tether that limits the towing ship\u2019s speed to about 3 mph. The AUV \u2014 a Bluefin 21 \u2014 can move slightly faster. Three AUVs were used to search a 40-square-mile area of the Atlantic where the Air France airliner went down. That search took several months.\nWhile sonar can pick up the signal of metal objects on the ocean floor, the ping sent out by the emergency beacon attached to the black box will fall silent in a matter of days. The battery that powers it has a life of 30 days, so it is expected to die in early April. Its signal carries for no more than three miles. Based on the passage above, What equipment is being used in the search for the missing plane and what are their limitations?",

    "user_prompt": "Given the text: For more than a century, the placement of dinosaurs on the branches of their family tree has been based on the shape of their hips.\nThis classification has now been radically challenged by proponents of a new tree which, if accepted, swaps large subfamilies around, sheds new light on dinosaurs\u2019 evolution and suggests they may have originated not in South America, as widely assumed, but perhaps in some Northern Hemisphere locality such as Scotland.\nA Victorian paleontologist, Harry Seeley, declared in 1888 that dinosaurs should be divided into the bird-hipped (Ornithischia) and the lizard-hipped (Saurischia) categories that have been accepted ever since.\nUnder this system, the heavily armored stegosaurs and ankylosaurs are placed on the Ornithischian branch of the family tree. The Saurischian branch includes both sauropods like the herbivorous diplodocus, and theropods like the meat-eating tyrannosaurs.\nThis longstanding classification has now been disputed by Matthew G. Baron of the University of Cambridge. Mr. Baron is a graduate student and his rewriting of the dinosaur family tree is a project to attain his Ph.D. But his ideas are supported by his two supervisors and co-authors, David B. Norman of the University of Cambridge, and Paul M. Barrett of the Natural History Museum in London, and by a prodigious database he has constructed of dinosaur anatomical features.\nMr. Baron started his work on the Ornithischian dinosaurs but came to feel they did not fit well in their place on the accepted family tree. With his supervisors\u2019 encouragement, he set out to reconsider the entire dinosaur classification system. More than 1,000 species have already been identified, most of them dating from between 200 million and 66 million years ago. Dinosaurs became the dominant terrestrial species after the first date, and perished, all save the lineage leading to birds, at the second.\nMr. Baron spent three years visiting museums throughout the world and assessed important dinosaur fossils for the presence of 457 diagnostic anatomical features. Based on this information, a computer program called TNT arranged the dinosaur specimens in possible family trees. After analyzing 32 billion trees, the computer spat out the best possible arrangement of Mr. Baron\u2019s three years\u2019 worth of data collection. The run took just five minutes.\nThe new family tree of dinosaurs, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, is quite unlike the old. \u201cThe results of this study challenge more than a century of dogma and recover an unexpected tree topology that necessitates fundamental reassessment of early dinosaur evolution,\u201d Mr. Baron and his supervisors write.\nEssentially they have found that the Ornithischian dinosaurs have many similarities with the theropods and so probably shared a common ancestor. As it happens, Thomas Huxley, the celebrated 19th century champion of Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, also thought Ornithischia and theropods belonged together in the same group, which he called Ornithoscelida. Mr. Baron says this name should be revived, with the two main branches of the new family tree being the Ornithoscelida and the Saurischia.\nMr. Baron\u2019s revolutionary new family tree may not be immediately accepted but experts seem likely to give it a serious hearing because of its database, the largest ever assembled, and its use of a standard tree-drawing program.\n\u201cIt will be interesting to see how paleontologists receive this original and provocative reassessment of dinosaur origins and relationships,\u201d Kevin Padian, a dinosaur expert at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in an accompanying commentary in Nature.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a radical proposal with a reasonable basis but no one expects it will be the last word,\u201d Dr. Padian said in an interview. Given that such a sudden shift in the dinosaur family tree might even be possible, people could wonder if dinosaur experts know what they\u2019re doing, he said. His answer is that they do, but they have been faced with an unusual problem. There has been an explosion of new discoveries in the last 30 years, showing that new dinosaur groups evolved with a mix of old features inherited from their ancestors and new ones shaped by natural selection. But the new features are the same in many cases, an instance of what biologists call convergent evolution, making it very hard to assign each group to its right place on the dinosaur family tree.\nPaul Sereno, a dinosaur specialist the University of Chicago who laid the basis for the modern version of Seeley\u2019s classification, said the new paper would certainly stir the pot but he couldn\u2019t see what new features or scoring system had contributed to the new result.\nMr. Baron said his work was not based on any new diagnostic features but on more data and the absence of any prior assumptions about what the tree should look like.\nHaving a correctly drawn family tree allows paleontologists to peer more deeply into the origins of the dinosaurs, because the species that lie close to the root of the major families may carry the same traits as the first dinosaur. Based on his tree, Mr. Baron believes that the original dinosaurs were small, two-footed animals with large grasping hands, as others have said before, but also omnivorous. Early dinosaurs had both knifelike teeth for eating meat and flatter teeth for chewing plants.\nThe new tree implies that dinosaurs emerged some 247 million years ago, a little earlier than previous estimates, and that their origin may not have been in South America, where several very early dinosaurs have been found. Some species that could have shared a common ancestor with the first dinosaur have been found in places now part of the Northern Hemisphere, such as Saltopus elginensis, a small dinosaurlike creature found in Scotland. But Dr. Norman said present sampling did not allow any region to be identified as the dinosaurs\u2019 place of origin, only that the Northern Hemisphere was just as likely as the Southern.\nThe proposed new family tree of dinosaurs has a lot of statistical support, Dr. Norman said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right, just that it\u2019s the best we can do with the data we\u2019ve got at the moment,\u201d he said.\nWhat does the proposed new family tree of dinosaurs suggest about the origins and characteristics of the first dinosaurs, such as their size, diet, and geographical location, based on the species that lie close to the root of major families?",

What does Russ Rader, a spokesman for the IIHS, recommend as a broader solution to distractions?\n\nGiven material: HELENA \u2013 A freshman lawmaker from Great Falls is championing a bill prohibiting bans on driving while talking on a cellphone or texting, saying studies have shown such restrictions to be ineffective.\n\u201cThey don\u2019t work,\u201d said Rep. Jeremy Trebas, R-Great Falls, who is the primary sponsor of House Bill 194, which will be heard Tuesday in front of the House Judiciary Committee. It prohibits local restrictions on use of mobile communications devices while operating a vehicle.\nThere are no statewide laws. However, as of late 2013, 10 Montana towns, cities and counties banned the use of cellphones and/or texting while driving. They are Billings, Bozeman, Columbia Falls, Great Falls, Hamilton, Helena, Missoula and Whitefish. Silver Bow-Butte and Anaconda-Deer Lodge also had bans.\nTrebas, who spoke against the Great Falls cellphone ban when it was instituted, points to a study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, which he said finds that such bans do not lead to decreases in collisions or claims.\nRuss Rader, spokesman for the Washington, D.C.-based Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, said his organization does not lobby or take positions on legislation.\nHe described the evidence as mixed on whether cellphone restrictions reduce crashes.\nGreat Falls Mayor Bob Kelly said he stands by the city\u2019s cellphone ban.\nThe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said distracted driving is dangerous, saying it claimed 3,179 lives in 2014. I said 46 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands ban text messaging for all drivers.\nAll but five have primary enforcement.\nTrebas said distractions can take many forms, including eating and noisy children in the back seat.\nRader said his institute points to the need of a broader solution to distractions that includes technology, such as alerting a driver to an imminent crash when not paying attention to the road or brake the vehicle if the driver does not react fast enough.\n\u201cThose systems are reducing crashes,\u201d he said, adding that automatic braking will be standard in vehicles by 2022.\nKelly said the law is not a money maker.\n\u201cThe point is to have people driving safely on our streets,\u201d he said.\nHe said he appreciates Trebas\u2019 reference to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety study, but he said the city also has studies from around the country and anecdotal evidence.\nTrebas assessed his chances of getting his bill, which has 10 co-sponsors, through the Legislature this session.",

I had in fact, taken a few days off from school to attend the Jaipur Literature Fest with my mother.\nThe Jaipur Literature Festival is a festival where authors and writers from around the world come together to read, discuss, debate and introduce their works and ideas. As you might have guessed, it is held in Jaipur, India, although recently JLF has branched out to Boulder and Melbourne.\nToday, I'll be discussing with you one of the discussions I attended, titled \"The Page is Mightier than the Screen\". Moderated by Chandrahas Choudhary, the discussion featured Richard Flanagan, Allan Hollinghurst, Neil Jordan and David Hare. All screenwriters and fiction authors of note, their literary knowledge shone through their witty remarks and questions.\nI am definitely for this statement. However, this does not mean that I don't like films or tv shows- because I do love those as well! In this write-up however, I plan on explaining some of the great points brought forth by the speakers, rather than present my own opinion. Nothing beats being at the festival, but hopefully these little tidbits encourage you to go to a similar Literature Festival some time in the near future!\nI'd like to know from you all whether you'd like to hear about these debates and discussions. Hopefully I've given you a good glimpse into the festival culture, and if you want to hear about these discussions, let me know in the comments below!\nSummarize the discussion titled \"The Page is Mightier than the Screen\" at Jaipur Literature Fest 2017.",

    "user_prompt": "3 Notable Campaigns in January 2016!\nBelow you will find three notable marketing campaigns that are in full swing this month! Each campaign is remarkable in its own way, but all three are using technology to gain more exposure.\nToyota launched a new Facebook campaign that serves custom videos/messages to users based on their likes and interests. This involves data from Facebook profiles and interchangeable video clips to create the necessary versions. The result for Toyota is promoting the RAV4 \u201cwhile also addressing the interests of the viewer with customized content based on their Facebook history,\u201d according to this article. One example, described here says that someone interested in scuba diving might see a Toyota message about \u201cyour next adventure\u201d. This is significant because they created more than 100 short video clips centered on different hobbies to reach this hyper-targeted experience for the user.\nH&R Block, the world\u2019s largest consumer tax preparation company, launched its new campaign this month that is targeting the millennial generation and includes a \u201c1,000 Win $1,000 Daily Sweepstakes\u201d. Their quirky new ads began airing earlier this month and the campaign will continue with a mix of TV and digital media, according to this article. However, it\u2019s the social component of their campaign that is most noteworthy. They are encouraging people to use #mygrandplan to share how they would use an extra $1,000. People are sharing their stories, as seen here! This is a perfect example of how a hashtag campaign can create conversations, build excitement for the sweepstakes, and promote their brand to new users.\nVisit Tampa Bay recently launched an international campaign to promote the city as a winter destination \u2013 especially to enjoy \u201cGasparilla season\u201d. The season spans two months of beautiful weather with parades, races, cultural events, and more! The word is spreading into countries such as England, Canada, and Germany (and some US cities too). The German campaign includes a 30 minute video program and the Canadian campaign focused on the hockey fans during a Maple Leafs/Lightning game in Toronto. This Saturday, the Gasparilla Pirate Invasion will be streaming live in London taxis! \u201cWe want to make them wish they were here,\u201d said Santiago Corrada, president and CEO of Visit Tampa Bay. Click here to learn more. As a side note, you can join over 40,000 others on the Gasparilla\u2019s Facebook Page.\nAlison joined the AMA Tampa Bay volunteer team this year as Digital Content Curator and Blog Writer. She is also Director of Marketing at Bright House Networks in St. Petersburg.\nHow is technology being used by the campaigns mentioned in the text to gain more exposure and engage with their audiences?",

    "user_prompt": "Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material\n\nQuestion/Instruction: What is the Molasky Corporate Center, and why is it significant in Las Vegas?\n\nGiven material: Sunday, April 22, 2007 | 7:17 a.m.\nWith multibillion-dollar resorts under construction up and down the Strip, one of the most significant buildings in the city isn't getting the attention it deserves.\nThe Molasky Corporate Center is almost ready to open, and its developers expect the 16-story project to be named the valley's first LEED-certified (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) office complex, and believe they'll get the gold level of certification, the second-highest level awarded by the U.S. Green Building Council.\nLegendary developer Irwin Molasky, who developed the Maryland Parkway retail corridor - including Boulevard mall and Sunrise Hospital - and downtown's first high-rise office tower, Bank of America Plaza, as well as the valley's first luxury high-rise condominium towers, Park Towers, is spending $107 million to build Molasky Corporate Center.\nThe building is costing Molasky about $7 million more than a non-LEED-certified building, and Molasky's development team knows the center won't recoup all the extra costs from energy savings or additional lease income.\nBut building green is the right thing to do, and Molasky and his team should be proud.\nI toured the center on Thursday with Sun and In Business Las Vegas real estate reporter Brian Wargo, and was quite impressed. The center is just west of the Molasky-built Internal Revenue Service building, the Union Pacific tracks and Main Street Station, north of the city's 61-acre parcel and northeast of the World Market Center.\nViews from the building are spectacular. The center is almost totally leased, and top tenants include the Southern Nevada Water Authority, the Las Vegas Valley Water District, the Molasky Group and two law firms, including Brownstein Hyatt Farber & Schreck.\nThe building takes full advantage of abundant natural light, pumps air conditioning and heating up from the floor instead of down from the ceiling, and was built using a high proportion of recycled materials.\nAmong the tenants is a 24 Hour Fitness gym, which will allow the building's workers to take a shower before work, a key benefit developers hope will entice folks to ride their bikes to work. There is also a coffee outlet and a Jason's Deli.\nDowntown Las Vegas hasn't had a new quality high-rise office building in years, and the fact that Molasky chose the site to build the valley's first LEED gold-certified office building is another sign of a revitalized downtown.\nIf you'd like to learn more about the Molasky Corporate Center, read the April 27-May 3 issue of In Business Las Vegas, which will include an in-depth look at the center as well as Wargo's Q&A with Molasky.\nA few developments stood out in another eventful week on the Strip.\nI'm sure MGM will eventually use the new acreage and the Circus Circus site for something big, and I believe they will spend the money needed to keep Circus Circus in reasonable shape for the rest of the decade.\nBut I'll be shocked if they keep the current Circus Circus, its buildings or its name. Once the company starts penciling out the billions that will be needed to redevelop the site, keeping the four-decade-old property won't make sense.\nUnfortunately the parking garage is still surrounded by the retail mall, the casino's still well above street level, the main entrance is still on Harmon Avenue, and the Planet Hollywood name long ago lost its panache. Lucky for Planet's owners that the resort is across the street from CityCenter, Cosmopolitan and Bellagio, a pretty sweet neighborhood.",

    "user_prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What are the reasons behind several contenders' demands to postpone the election, and what was the response of the LKP in the end?\n\nPassage: The main opposition Liberty Korea Party said Friday that it will hold its leadership election slated for late February as scheduled.\nAt an emergency meeting with party members, the conservative party decided to hold a national convention to pick its new leader and senior officials on Feb. 27.\nThe decision was made to guarantee fairness despite earlier concerns that the election could clash with a second summit between the United States and North Korea.\nSeveral contenders had demanded that the election be postponed to March as it could be overshadowed by the second summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to be held from Feb. 27-28 in Vietnam.\nThe leadership election is a crucial event for the survival of the LKP ahead of the 2020 parliamentary elections.\nEarlier, six of the eight contenders said that they will boycott the national convention if the party fails to postpone it and to accept their demands about changes to election rules.\nFour minor contenders issued a statement saying that two big-name candidates -- Hong Joon-pyo, former leader of the LKP and former Seoul Mayor Oh Se-hoon -- had agreed verbally to their request for a postponement.\nBut former prime minister Hwang Kyo-ahn, another high-profile contender, and Rep. Kim Jin-tae did not want the election to be delayed.\n\u201cThe national convention should be postponed by at least two weeks,\u201d the statement asserted.\nHwang is viewed by conservative voters as one of the most favorable candidates for the 2022 presidential election, recent polls showed.\nStill, he faces stigma for being closely affiliated with former President Park Geun-hye, who was ousted in March 2017 due to a massive corruption scandal.\nHwang served as acting president when Park was suspended from office by parliamentary impeachment in late 2016. The LKP is still stung by the fallout from Park\u2018s ouster.\nFormer LKP chairman Hong claimed that Hwang\u2019s return will aggravate an image of the party being tied to Park\u2018s impeachment.\nHong resigned in disgrace from the party chairmanship right after the party\u2019s crushing defeat in local elections last June.\nOh, who announced his bid Thursday, stressed the need to overcome the Park-related stigma in order for the party to make a turnaround.",

    "user_prompt": "Most specifically, social change implies the involvement of a large number of individuals in group dealings and tasks which differ from the interactions and activities that their parents (or even they themselves) participated in earlier (Vago, 1992). The word 'society' may be used to describe a multifaceted network of relationship patterns wherein every member takes part to different extents. Social relationships and behaviors undergo simultaneous modification. People encounter novel scenarios that they must react to. Such scenarios reflect factors like the institution of novel methods, novel means of earning, home shifts, novel inventions, social standards and concepts (Mutekwe, 2012).\nTechnology, in its most rudimentary sense, may be likened to social change. Technology's sociological importance is: its value transcends the tool by a great degree. Groups' adopted technology forms set the base for their respective non-material cultures. Indeed, technology even affects how individuals think and connect with each other (Stromquist, 2005).\nBerson and Whithworth (2003) state that technology and computers' effect (as an instructional subject as well as technique) on the field of social studies is huge. Technology-oriented learning can aid the development of pupils' problem resolution and decision-making abilities, communication skills and data processing abilities (Yigit, 2013).\nSocial and geographical movement, medicine, education and corporations are the main areas in which the computer's effect is most greatly felt (World Bank, 2009). Doctors use computer technology to probe the human body's internal unseen recesses for ascertaining the functioning of its many parts or for assessing whether or not an operation is required. Surgeons are able to operate on earlier-inaccessible brain regions and unborn babies (King, 1994). Microchips are a herald of ever bigger technological marvels in the future. In the academic arena, the computer persistently works wonders. Thus, nearly all-American schools have introduced the computer to pupils of all grades and taught them to type and use scientific and mathematical software applications. Quality academic programs utilize game-like teaching patterns for making pupils forget the fact that they are learning. The computer works to a profounder degree in organizations, transforming social relations (Mutekwe, 2012).\nThe social equilibrium theory addresses modifications transpiring in a particular segment of society, together with the adjustments required in diverse segments. The failure to ensure this may threaten social equilibrium and give rise to problems. Web users are also able to interact with other people from far-flung areas. This can generate strain disparities as the economically disadvantaged ignore particular sociological events and are geographically restricted when it comes to jobs, educational prospects, and healthcare opportunities on hand (Howard, Busch, & Sheets, 2010). Based on the passage above, How has computer technology impacted various industries such as medicine, education, and corporations?",

    "user_prompt": "Namco Bandai announced yesterday that the latest in the Dragon Ball series of games, Dragon Ball: Origins 2, will be arriving State-side this summer and, best of all, it'll be arriving with co-op. The single-player portion of the game will revolve around the adventures of Son Goku as he takes on the Red Ribbon Army, while the co-op portion will be a separate piece that's focused on specific co-op challenges for two players. Players will unlock these challenges through progress in their single-player campaign, though hopefully there will be some challenges available to players from the start. Keep reading for the full press release as well as a few screen shots from the upcoming title.\nSANTA CLARA, Calif., (Feb. 18, 2010) \u2013 Leading video game publisher and developer NAMCO BANDAI Games America Inc., announced today that Dragon Ball\u00ae: Origins 2 exclusively for Nintendo DS\u2122 will be available in North America this summer. A follow-up to the original Dragon Ball: Origins for DS, Dragon Ball: Origins 2 continues the story of series hero Goku\u2019s early years as he and his friends search the world for the seven enchanted Dragon Balls. The new action-adventure game includes an array of features including the ability to play as different characters along the way and the option to team up with a friend for co-op multiplayer challenges.\nIn Dragon Ball: Origins 2, players battle through the Red Ribbon Army saga covering Goku\u2019s first encounters with the nefarious Red Ribbon Army up to the resurrection of Upa\u2019s father, a member of the native tribe who serve as the guardians of the mystical Korin Tower. Players have the chance to play not only as Goku, but also the added variety of familiar faces he encounters as the journey progresses including Krillin, Bulma, Yamcha and more, each with their own abilities and power-ups. The whimsical and beloved graphical style of the series comes to life as animated cut-scenes unfold the story.\nA challenging mix of action and exploration awaits, as Goku and friends must use a wide range of skills to solve puzzles, find treasure chests, and defeat armies of baddies. A situation-based camera adapts with the changing gameplay to bring players closer to the action. An overhead view allows players a broad perspective as they jump, swing and charge through forests, underwater areas and more. Meanwhile, key boss battles switch to side-view to emphasize the signature fighting style of the Dragon Ball series. With support for both stylus and button input options, players are free to choose their preferred control style.\nIn addition to an exciting single-player mode, two players can join up for satisfying co-op multiplayer challenges via a wireless local connection. By playing the single-player adventure, special multiplayer stages including challenging boss fights unlock and become available. Players are also able to carry over their saved character from the single-player mode as they battle alongside friends in co-op mode.\nDragon Ball: Origins 2 for Nintendo DS\u2122 will be available in summer 2010. For more information about the game, please visit www.namcobandaigames.com or http://dragonball.namco.com. To join the official fan community, please visit http://www.gokuscorner.com.\nThe first game, Dragon Ball: Origins, was fairly well-received, so hopefully the second one will be as good, if not better; and hopefully the co-op challenges will prove to be a fun addition.\nPage created in 1.0696 seconds.\nHow does the camera adapt to the changing gameplay in Dragon Ball: Origins 2?",

They\u2019re made with an egg-free (and dairy-free!) cookie dough base and a chocolate peanut butter topping. They\u2019re a naturally vegan dessert and totally addictive!\nHey, friends! This is Kristen from the blog The Endless Meal. I love popping over here once a month to share with you a tasty recipe I\u2019ve been dreaming up. Over on my blog, I like to share (mostly) healthy recipes that are delicious AND easy to make. You can sign up here and I\u2019ll send you 2-3 delicious recipes for free each week.\nOne of the reasons I love sharing a recipe here each month is it gives me a reason to treat my family (and you guys!) to an extra special recipe. Think Lemon Raspberry Loaf Cake, Frosted Lemon Cookies, and now these No Bake Peanut Butter Cookie Dough Bars.\nI don\u2019t always share dessert recipes with you, but they are some of my favorites.\nThese cookie dough bars are made without eggs! They\u2019re also made using coconut oil instead of butter so they\u2019re naturally dairy-free and vegan. Awesome!\nThe base is made from delicious chocolate chip cookie dough and then a thick layer of sweet and slightly chocolaty peanut butter is spread on top. I like to drizzle a little melted chocolate and sprinkle some powdered sugar and cocoa powder on top for fun, too.\nQuick sidebar from these cookie dough bars ? Have you ever thought of starting your own blog? If you have (yay!) I teach a course that is all about how to start a blog and make it successful. You can read all about it here. ?\nOk, back to these cookie dough bars. Will you promise me you\u2019ll make them? I promise you won\u2019t be disappointed!\nThese delicious No Bake Peanut Butter Cookie Dough Bars are the ultimate treat. They're made with an egg free (and dairy-free!) cookie dough base and a chocolate peanut butter topping. They're a naturally vegan dessert and totally addictive.\nLine an 8x8 inch pan with parchment paper.\nIn a medium sized bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and sea salt. In a large bowl, whisk the sugars with the melted coconut oil, water, and chia seeds. Add the dry ingredients all at once and stir till combined. Press into the prepared pan and place it in your fridge.\nIn a medium sized bowl, beat the powdered sugar, peanut butter, and melted chocolate chips until it resembles batter. Spoon this on top of the cookie dough and smooth out using a spatula. Place the pan back into the fridge.\nHeat the milk in a small pan over medium heat until it begins to steam. Remove the pan from the heat and add the chocolate chips. Let the pan sit for a few moments to melt the chocolate chips then whisk to combine. Drizzle the top of the bars with the chocolate.\nCut the bars into 24 pieces - see notes. Store the cookie dough bars, covered, in your fridge.\nThese cookie dough bars are best cut into 24 pieces, rather than the 12 pieces like in the pictures. They're a deliciously rich dessert.\nI've sprinkled a little powdered sugar and cocoa powder on top, but this is really only for aesthetics and does not affect the taste.\nWhat kind of chocolate chips did you use that are naturally vegan?\nMost dark chocolate chips are vegan. Just be sure to read the ingredients list if you are avoiding dairy. For this recipe, I used Kirkland Signature \u2013 the Costco brand. They are dairy free. Based on the passage above, How should the bars be stored after they are made?",

    "user_prompt": "Given the text: The first phase of the deal will see REC acquiring a majority stake valued at about $2.5 billion in Power Finance, possibly by the year ending March 2019.\nIndia is considering a proposal to combine two state-run lenders to utilities, REC Ltd. and Power Finance Corp., according to people familiar with the discussions, as it seeks to raise funds to bridge a budget gap.\nThe first phase of the deal will see REC acquiring a majority stake valued at about $2.5 billion in Power Finance, possibly by the year ending March 2019, the people said, asking not to be named as the talks aren\u2019t public. Subsequently, the plan is to merge the subsidiary with REC, a departure from the original plan to keep their operations separate. Power Finance had a market value of 268.8 billion rupees ($3.8 billion) on Tuesday.\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s government is seeking ways to narrow the country\u2019s budget deficit to help finance public welfare projects ahead of elections. The sale of the stake in Power Finance mirrors a similar deal earlier this year, when state explorer Oil & Natural Gas Corp. bought a controlling stake in refiner Hindustan Petroleum Corp.\nThe merger plan is being considered after REC expressed concern that just acquiring a controlling stake in Power Finance would weaken its credit profile and wouldn\u2019t yield any operational benefit. On the other hand, New Delhi-based REC has informed the power ministry that a combined entity will be complementary as it would eliminate competition among them in raising funds or finding customers, according to the people involved in the plan.\nA combined power sector lender can leverage its size to borrow at lower rates and help fund the nation\u2019s goal of ensuring round-the-clock supply of affordable electricity for all Indians and also help fund projects beyond the electricity sector. A bigger lender will also help instill better discipline among borrowers, especially distribution companies, the people said.\nPress offices at REC, Power Finance and the power ministry didn\u2019t respond to emails seeking comment, while calls made to the finance ministry\u2019s spokesman were not answered.\nREC shares fell as much as 0.9 percent to 120.85 rupees in early trade in Mumbai on Wednesday, while Power Finance declined as much as 2.1 percent to 99.65 rupees. The government has a 65.6 percent holding in Power Finance, which has gained 27 percent since Bloomberg first reported the government\u2019s plan to sell its stake to REC on Sept. 24, while REC has advanced 24 percent.\nREC is keen on the merged entity to subsequently extend its lending book beyond the power sector and wants oversight of its operations shifted to the finance ministry, the people said. The company changed its name, discarding the earlier Rural Electrification Corp., last month as it limited the scope of doing business.\nHow does REC plan to extend its lending beyond the power sector through the merged entity, and what changes does it want to see in oversight of its operations?",

    "user_prompt": "Can you provide a summary of Iraq's actions during the Arab-Israeli War of 1973 and its stance on the ceasefire and interim agreements negotiated by Egypt and Syria with Israel in 1974 and 1975? Answer according to: On February 8, 1963, Kassem was overthrown by a group of officers, most of them members of the Baath Party; he was assassinated the following day. Abdul Salam Arif became president, and relations with the Western world improved. In April 1966 Arif was killed in a helicopter crash and was succeeded by his brother, General Abdul Rahman Arif.\nDuring the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War (1967), Iraqi troops and planes were sent to the Jordan-Israeli border. Iraq subsequently declared war on Israel and closed its oil pipeline supplying the Western nations, which it accused of siding with Israel. At the same time diplomatic relations with the United States were severed. In July 1968 Baath Party officers overthrew General Arif\u2019s government. Major General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, a former prime minister, was appointed head the newly established Revolutionary Command Council (RCC), the country\u2019s supreme executive, legislative, and judicial body.\nIn the following years Iraq maintained general hostility toward the West and friendship with the USSR. The positions of individual Arab countries with regard to Israel caused some friction between Iraq and its neighbors. In 1971 Iraq closed its border with Jordan and called for its expulsion from the Arab League because of Jordan\u2019s efforts to crush the Palestinian guerrilla movement operating inside its borders.\nFrom 1972 to 1975 Iraq fully nationalized the foreign oil companies operating in Iraq. The country enjoyed a massive increase in oil revenues starting in late 1973 when international petroleum prices began a steep rise. The discovery of major oil deposits in the vicinity of Baghdad was announced publicly in 1975.\nIraq aided Syria with troops and materiel during the Arab-Israeli War of 1973. Calling for continued military action against Israel, Iraq denounced the ceasefire that ended the 1973 conflict and opposed the interim agreements negotiated by Egypt and Syria with Israel in 1974 and 1975.",

    "user_prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What was the impact of the Bank of Japan's inaction on markets and currencies?\n\nPassage: Asia markets took \"sell in May\" sentiment to heart on Monday, with the Japanese benchmark index tumbling over 3 percent and Australian bank shares selling off.\nThe Nikkei 225 closed down 518.67 points, or 3.11 percent, at 16,147.38, after initially tumbling as much as 4.14 percent in early trade. On Thursday, the benchmark index shed 3.61 percent, after the Bank of Japan surprised markets by standing pat on its monetary policy.\nIn South Korea, the Kospi ended down 16 points, or 0.80 percent at 1,978.15. Down Under, the ASX 200 retraced most of its morning losses of over 1 percent to close down 9.21 points, or 0.18 percent, at 5,243.00, with the heavily-weighted financials sub-index finishing down 1.56 percent.\nMarkets in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia are closed for a public holiday.\nJapan's market turmoil may be spreading around the region, analysts said.\n\"While lingering disappointment from the Bank of Japan's inaction continues to weigh in Japanese markets, negative sentiment started filtering through to other global markets and this ripple effect should be closely monitored as the negative impact from waning global risk sentiment could add more fuel to an already overheated yen,\" Stephen Innes, senior trader at OANDA, said in a note Monday. He expects the yen may strengthen further.\nMajor Japanese exporters sold off sharply, with shares of Toyota closing down 3.75 percent, Nissan down 4.95 percent and Honda off 3.98 percent in the wake of a stronger yen, which is usually negative for exporters as it makes their products less competitive overseas and decreases their overseas profits when converted back into the Japanese currency.\nThe Japanese yen traded at 106.51 against the dollar on Monday as of 2:35 p.m. HK/SIN, up 0.16 percent from an earlier low of 106.14. But that still marks a significantly stronger Japanese currency, as the pair traded at the lower range of the 107 level on Friday afternoon Asia time and at levels above 111 last week.\nKit Juckes, global fixed income strategist at Societe Generale, said the dollar/yen pair \"looks like a lemming hurling itself off a cliff, and the yen bulls may end up feeling a bit like lemmings in due course.\"\nSony shares dropped 4.01 percent after the company reported a loss of 88.3 billion yen for the fiscal fourth quarter on Thursday after the market close.\nAirbag maker Takata saw its shares tumble 9.25 percent after Reuters reported more than 100 million vehicles globally are likely to be subject to recalls over the company's problematic airbag inflators.\nPanasonic dropped 7.37 percent after Reuters reported the company said its profit is likely to fall this fiscal year.\nDown under, Australia's major banks dropped, with shares of Westpac closing down 3.54 percent. The bank announced results for the six months ended March 31, 2016, on Monday morning, with cash earnings up 3 percent to 3.9 billion Australian dollar ($2.96 billion) on-year, missing the forecast for A$4.07 billion from six analysts polled by Reuters.\nIn a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange, Westpac said cash earnings growth was lower due to higher impairment charges.\nThe country's other major banks also sold off, with shares of ANZ down 2.22 percent, Commonwealth Bank of Australia down 2.10 percent and National Australia Bank dropping 2.06 percent.\nThe Australian dollar was up 0.08 percent at $0.7608 in the late afternoon local time, after falling from levels above $0.77 last week on the back of weaker-than-expected inflation data. The Aussie will be in focus this week as the Reserve Bank of Australia meets on Tuesday, with some analysts expecting further easing of its monetary policy.\nShares of Virgin Australia gave up gains to close down 5.71 percent, following the company's announcement that it will cut capacity by 5.1 percent in the fiscal fourth quarter, citing uncertainties around the upcoming Federal election, weak consumer demand and the downturn in the resources sector.\nIn the currency market, the dollar index, which measures the dollar against a basket of currencies, was down 0.10 percent at 92.992 as of 2:45 p.m. HK/SIN, compared with touching levels near 95 in the previous week.\nOil prices retreated during Asian hours, with U.S. crude futures down 0.70 percent to $45.60 a barrel in the afternoon, while Brent futures dropped 0.97 percent to $46.91.\nEnergy plays were mixed in Asia, with shares of Santos finishing down 1.67 percent, Woodside Petroleum up 1.41 percent and Inpex dropping 3.76 percent.\nOn Friday, major U.S. indexes closed lower, with the Dow Jones industrial average finishing down 0.32 percent, the S&P 500 off by 0.51 percent and the Nasdaq composite down 0.62 percent.",

    "user_prompt": "Marketing asset management software helps marketing teams centralize content, streamline the creative workflow and increase collaboration. Distribution and access are easier than ever with a marketing asset management solution, allowing creatives to focus more on creating.\nRead on to learn about six ways that marketing asset management software can become an invaluable tool to improve marketing processes for your team.\nHow Can Marketing Asset Management Software Help My Team?\nA single source of truth drives collaboration and reduces redundant work by collecting all of your team\u2019s content into a single location that everyone can access.\nHaving a central hub for image acquisition and collaborative marketing workflow allows for a more agile and creative process. A single source also adds visibility to ensure assistance is available when and where it is needed. Users will never again waste time and energy by going on a content scavenger hunt.\nMediaBeacon\u2019s client proven content solutions define the creative workflow, allowing for seamless and secure appropriation of assets in real time. MediaBeacon integrates all components of acquiring content from data input, to rights management, to embargoing and restricting access to content. Take a look at an example in this marketing workflow infographic.\nMediaBeacon's web-based UI supports multiple methods of ingesting and classifying content. Its user driven interface supports simple drag-and-drop upload with the power of enterprise data indexing.\nWith MediaBeacon, intelligent synchronization delivers files to the users before they need them. This is driven by an intuitive understanding of the organization\u2019s creative workflow. All of these operations are seamlessly executed in the background, without requiring user intervention.\nWith repositories reaching millions of records, organization has never been a bigger opportunity for reducing content to market time. Users reach for the simplest way to work and without MAM, sometimes that means re-creating content. Centralized organization also allows for a wide view of what content is available and where it has previously been used. Less time is spent tracking down assets and more time is spent creating content and driving initiatives.\nWith MediaBeacon's powerful search, data is intuitively indexed and organically organized into user friendly facets, which guide Creatives to the content they are looking for. MediaBeacon discovers the data that lives in the assets and adopts data via integrations and user inputs. All of the data is stored in the industry standard XMP format making the key information accessible to any application, anywhere. MediaBeacon not only indexes the data for each asset, it pre-calculates asset relationships, creates taxonomies, and maintains a lineage of assets over their lifecycle.\nMAM is the the center of the creative world, applying best practices across all the departments in the organization. Implementing the correct technologies allows for soft touch collaboration, where users are not held hostage by upstream backlogs. Content can be created simultaneously and be brought together as it\u2019s ready. The review process is flexible and collaborative for each individual case.\nContent management now extends beyond the management and retention of content. It is valuable from concept to consumer. Distribution is not simply delivering files outside of the MAM workflow, it involves many aspects of information gathering and often utilizes a progressive feedback loop from the stakeholders.\nMediaBeacon has the ability actively distribute content through a wide range mechanisms, including accelerated transfer tools. MediaBeacon can transform content into the format and data structure required by the consumer. Watermarks, digital rights notifications and intended usage information can be applied on transfer.\nPublishing content through 3rd party Web Content Management integrations ensures the right photos are used in the right multimedia formats at the right time. This adds the power of enterprise search to the versatility of the web content tools.\nAssets can also easily be shared or distributed to third parties through various methods such as download link, email attachment, synced folder and more.\nEvery day your organization is producing valuable data. Being able to analyze this big data is pivotal to excelling beyond the competition. Knowing how you\u2019re doing is tough if you\u2019re not tracking it. Analytics automatically track work and display explorational metrics. Users can see the most popular searches and the results, focusing and fine tuning data for the consumer.\nHaving this added insight into the data your company is always producing allows for educated changes, improving the efficiencies within your organization. Let's say a particular keyword is identified through the use of metrics that isn't resulting in an asset being used. The action we can take with that is either tag the appropriate assets with this keyword so they begin being used or if that content doesn't exist to create it. We can drive this even further: If you tie other systems into your marketing asset management system, you can better tie value to certain assets. If you group these assets by creator and bring the most valuable assets to the top, you can identify those on your team that are contributing the most to your revenue.\nAdministrators can see content as it moves across departments and statuses, providing support at the critical points it is required.\nExecutive level can capture the ROI driven by the creative team pulling in data from multiple sources and comparing real marketing initiatives against revenue data.\nKPI driven businesses have set a new bar of efficiency and effective management of the supply chain. And, real-time reports are available at every level and across every department.\nA lot of time is spent searching for files in an organization that doesn\u2019t have a Marketing Asset Management solution. Some estimates report that employees spend 9.3 hours per week searching and gathering information.\nImplementing a MAM system can turn that time back into productive and creative time.\nHaving a MAM, like MediaBeacon, acts as the center of your content-driven universe by tracking all files, no matter their status, by leveraging metadata. Now questions like, \u201cwhich file is correct, appropriate, or final?\u201d can easily be answered. MediaBeacon helps your team manage this by keeping your assets indexed for quick and easy finding, as well as logical and automatic organization. It is your single source of truth.\nHow can the use of marketing asset management software lead to better analytics and ROI tracking for a business?",

    "user_prompt": "How can measuring your own output in content marketing help you stay on track and justify your budget to management?: You already know you should be offering content marketing services to your clients, as well as heavily producing your own ebooks, guides and blogs. Content marketing increases brand awareness, generates new leads and nurtures those leads into customers. But something we have not quite figured out yet is how to gauge its effectiveness. Wouldn't it be smart to measure the type, frequency and interactivity of our content to measure its effectiveness as a function of outcomes and to keep ourselves on track for achieving performance goals? We think so.\nHere, we discuss several content marketing KPIs you should be measuring to do just that.\nSome of these are straightforward to measure if you have marketing automation in place or even basic blogging tools, such as Wordpress plug-ins. Others will require some digging, for example isolating the number of customers whose first or last touch was content. Some tools are better than others for putting this data together, and in a future post, we will examine specific methods for tracking these metrics. Ideally, every digital marketing department should have one or more data analysts whose mission (and passion) is figuring out how to glean KPIs from all of the marketing big data you collect.\nFor now, I would recommend starting with measuring your own output. How often do you blog and create offers for lead generation? Staying accountable for regular production and publication is one of the bastions of inbound marketing success. Tracking those efforts keeps you moving forward and lets your management team know that you are spending those content marketing dollars consistently and following your plan. Measuring the interactivity of your content and some of the conversion KPIs will give them at least some idea of how effective your content marketing program is becoming and help to justify your budget.\nWith over 30 years of business and marketing experience, John loves to blog about ideas and trends that challenge inbound marketers and sales and marketing executives.

    "user_prompt": "What are some questions that a company should ask itself before deciding to use pay-per-click advertising with Google AdWords? Answer according to: Digital marketers must learn how to write clearly and persuasively. This is important for blog posts and website content. You should know how to use WordPress, have basic photo editing skills, be able to format with html, and use MailChimp or other email management tools.\nGoogle AdWords is another important tool. Digital marketers should learn how to run Facebook ads. You also need to know how to market through social media by engaging with customers. You need to understand the basics of search engine optimization and understand how conversation rate optimization works as well.\nMany people see Google AdWords as a game of chance. It\u2019s true that AdWords is hard to master, but it\u2019s a tool to generate revenue; it works the same for everyone. You should remember that you\u2019re not playing against Google \u2013 you\u2019re playing against other opponents.\nYou pay a cost-per-click amount, which is small in relation to your ROI. So know what game you\u2019re playing, so you recognize how well you\u2019re doing. Recognize your true competition, so that you compete better. And remember, getting help with AdWords is not cheating.\nA pay-per-click advertising campaign with Google AdWords can be an effective marketing tactic for lead generation. Determine if PPC is a good option for your company by asking questions. Start with Google Adwords, because Google owns 67 percent of the search market.\nFirst, are prospective customers searching what what you do? What keywords are they searching for? These can be vital. What negative keywords should you use? Does your ad copy match the search terms? Make sure your ads are relevant. Is your landing page specific to your topic? Also, how are you tracking success.

    "user_prompt": "What are some alternative forms of media that may be more cost-efficient for smaller advertisers?: 1 What Are the Advantages of Advertising on TV?\nDespite shifts in ad spending to online and mobile media, television advertising is still a good choice for ad spending for branding purposes and large businesses. However, for smaller advertisers who are looking for a return on their investment, other forms of media like online, radio, print and outdoor are more efficient in both cost and performance.\nFor any type of advertising, frequency is important. You can't run an ad just once and expect people to remember it or you. Establishing name and brand awareness via repeat TV spots is the best approach. When advertising on TV, a company must convey that it is an established and credible business. A long-lasting presence helps ensure viewers think of your business when the need for your products or services arise. This approach is both costly and time consuming.\nProducing a quality 30-second national TV spot can cost as much as $350,000, well beyond the reach of smaller businesses. Producing a spot with a local agency to air on local television is considerably cheaper, but it can still run into thousands of dollars. Trying to cut corners could end up backfiring, as a poorly produced TV spot can actually reflect poorly on your businesses image, and decrease response. You've seen the commercials, usually on late-night TV, that look and sound like they were produced in someone's garage.\nSometimes, commercials produced by a local TV station or a low-budget freelancer trying to break into the business end up like that. Most of the time, it would be better not to run a TV commercial than to run one that's poorly produced.\nIf a TV commercial is properly produced, it is difficult to make changes to the message you are conveying about your business efficiently and quickly. If a business wants to advertise a special offer, or a new product or service, a new spot must be produced, and time slots need to be purchased, which could be time consuming. Other media like online banner ads or radio voice overs can be produced and/or edited usually in-house, quickly and efficiently.\nTelevision advertising relies on third party audience tracking companies, like Nielsen and Comscore, to determine audience demographics and ad targets. While their tracking technology has improved with the proliferation of digital TV, it still does not offer the level of audience and performance tracking as online media. This makes television advertising disadvantageous to smaller companies looking to clearly see the returns on an advertising investment.\nThe availability of so many types of media today means people aren't watching as much television as they did before. Young adults in particular have switched to movie and TV show subscription services like Netflix and Hulu that are cheaper than cable. So the chances of them seeing your television commercial are much smaller today. That doesn't mean TV advertising is necessarily a bad idea, but it depends on your budget.\nConsider other, less expensive media, too, like social media and online websites where many people now get their news.\nDoc, Tommy. \"The Disadvantages of Advertising on Television.\" Small Business - Chron.com, http://smallbusiness.chron.com/disadvantages-advertising-television-27718.html. 28 January 2019.",

    "user_prompt": "What ingredients are used to make the pear-apple sauce that goes with the latke, and how is it prepared?: We love a good classic latke, don't get us wrong. But if we're really honest, the plain potato pancake trotted out each Hanukkah could use a little refresher. So we introduced it to a Chinese scallion pancake. The result is a scallion- and sesame-loaded potato mix, held together with panko and made superbly crispy with the help of sesame oil. The recipe makes one large latke that's easily sliced like pizza to feed a party.\nAnd while we were at it, we thought latkes' typical accompaniments, applesauce and sour cream, could use little refresh, too. So we added Asian pear and star anise to our apples and laced our sour cream with some spicy sambal.\nWhen cooking the latke, use a fish spatula to help loosen it from the skillet before flipping, so that you don't scuff its perfectly deep golden crust.\nLatkes will never be the same.\n1. Make the pear-apple sauce: In a large saucepan, combine the apple and pear pieces, lemon juice, water and star anise. Cover and cook over medium-high heat until soft, 10 to 12 minutes. Uncover, reduce the heat to medium and continue to cook, occasionally mashing the fruit until they form a thick compote, 5 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and let cool. Makes 2 cups of pear-apple sauce and can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.\n2. While the sauce is cooking, make the sambal sour cream: In a small bowl, stir together the sour cream and sambal. Cover and chill until ready to serve.\n3. Make the latke: On a large, clean kitchen towel, toss the shredded potatoes with 1\u00bd teaspoons of salt. Wrap in a bundle, twisting the top to close, and wring out the potato liquid over a large bowl. Discard the liquid and wipe the bowl clean, then transfer the shredded potatoes to it, along with the scallions, panko bread crumbs, egg and remaining salt, and stir to combine.\n4. In a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat, add the canola oil. When the oil is rippling hot, add the latke mixture in 1 even layer. Don't press down. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of sesame oil around the inside edge of the skillet where it meets the latke. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook until the bottom is deep golden brown and crispy, 15 minutes.\n5. Cover the skillet with a large inverted plate and turn the pan over to transfer the latke onto the plate. Slide the latke back into the skillet, cooked-side up, and drizzle the remaining sesame oil using the same method as before. Cook until deep golden brown and crispy, 15 minutes more.\n6. Slide the latke onto a cutting board and evenly drizzle the soy sauce over the top. Garnish with the black sesame seeds and green scallions. Cut into wedges and serve with the pear-apple sauce and sambal sour cream.",

    "user_prompt": "Today I want to show you how to make slip stitch crochet flower coasters! You'll learn slip stitch embroidery with an easy step-by-step. It's a great way to dress up plain crochet and add extra color to a piece.\nYou'll be making a basic crochet circle coaster and embroidering it with a simple slip stitch design. This easy 10 step tutorial is written with no abbreviations and with plenty of photos for the beginner. Let's get started!\n1.Grab your materials. You'll need a US I/9 (5.5mm) crochet hook, two colors of yarn (don't look too closely at the blue - it's coffee-stained), and a pair of scissors. Also a yarn needle, which I forgot to picture.\nGrab your main color and make a slip knot. Chain 4 and join with a slip stitch to the first chain to make a circle.\n3.First round! Chain 1, work 10 single crochet stitches in the circle. Join to the first single crochet with a slip stitch to close the round. Quick tip: I like to crochet over the beginning tail to reduce weaving in later. Lazy step!\n4. Work round two. Chain 1, work 2 single crochet stitches in first single crochet you joined to in the last round and in each single crochet around. Join to the first single crochet with a slip stitch to close the round. You will have 20 single crochet stitches. The 2 single crochets worked in one stitch is called an increase and you'll be making these increases throughout the next few rounds.\n5.Increase the next round. Chain 1, work 1 single crochet in first single crochet you joined to, *increase in the next stitch, single crochet in the next stitch, repeat from * around, ending with an increase in the last single crochet. Join to first single crochet with a slip stitch to close the round. You now have 30 single crochet stitches.\n6. Continue to increase. Work one more round like this, working increases on the 2nd stitch of each previous increase, and working single stitches between increases. You will have 40 stitches.\n7.Finish the coaster. Chain 1, work 1 single crochet in first single crochet you joined to and in each stitch around. Join to first single crochet with a slip stitch to close the round. Work one more even round, then fasten off.\n8. Begin slip stitch embroidery! Grab your second color yarn (you won't need very much, so this is a great way to use up scrap yarn). This is a little intuitive, meaning you don't have to do any exact counting. Holding your yarn at the back of the coaster, insert your hook from front to back through any stitch on the first round. Grab the yarn with the hook and pull through. Insert the hook into the next stitch in the second round, grab the yarn with the hook and pull through. Chain stitch!\n9. Make the flower. Using the technique I just showed you, slip stitch in and out of stitches in a flower pattern, working up and round in petals. This is pretty intuitive and doesn't need to look precise - as long as it looks like a flower and has at least 5 petals, we're good. :) Slip stitch a circle around the last round if you'd like, just for extra definition.\n10.Finish everything! Fasten off your second color yarn and weave everything in using the yarn needle. If you want, you can iron your coasters using the low steam setting to flatten them a bit.\nTa-da! You just made a set of super cute flowered coasters! Make them in all sorts of color combos and toss them around your living room for a bright snippet of spring.\nHow can I use slip stitch embroidery to add extra color and texture to my crochet projects?",

    "user_prompt": "Texas [Ed]Tech: My Daily Research Workflow: Read. Store. Share. A recent survey found that the average American spends 973.2 hours a day online. Not really. But it definitely feels that way. And since we spend so much time online, often doing the same task hundreds of times (closing a tab, opening a link, sending a tweet), we condemn ourselves to a Sisyphus-like existence if we're inefficient in the way we work. In the interest of helping the world become more productive, I thought I'd offer the tools and workflow I use to stay current and connected in 20 minutes day. I follow a whole mess of blogs that focus on educational technology, and another bunch that deal with other topics I find interesting, most of which relate back to education. Going to over a hundred blogs a day is not going to happen (especially in my 20 minute time frame), so I use FlowReader to collect all their feeds in one place. There are several RSS readers out there (Feedly being the most popular), but FlowReader was my rebound reader after the one I had been using bit the dust. I thought it would only be a brief, fleeting romance until I stumbled on something better, but I've found that I'm drawn to FlowReader's simplicity: a clean, no-frills list of new posts. Diigo is where I collect everything I find that I think might be useful, either for myself or the teachers I work with. I tag resources by content area (ELA, math), device type (Chromebook, iPad), or ISTE student standard (collaboration, research) so I can do a quick search by any of those terms later on and find a resources that I've already curated. It makes trainings way easier when I have a bank of ideas ready to draw from. The times of day I do my research (early morning, lunch) are not always when the rest of my PLN is perusing their Twitter feed. If I'm going to be a good resource for my online community, I need to schedule my posts to go out at a time when people will actually see them. For that, I use Buffer. The free version of Buffer lets you schedule up to 10 posts that you want to share. Set your times for when most of your community is online and Buffer will automatically send them for you. The bulk of my scheduled tweets go out between 8:00 - 9:30 p.m. and 2:00 - 3:00 a.m. (CST) since these are prime times for interactions. When people are reading, favoriting, and retweeting, I feel useful, which means that I'm accomplishing my third goal. The three tools listed above are all held together with Chrome. I'm a diehard user, even though I question some of the recent tweaks made to my beloved browser (Silverlight, where art thou?). My zealous fanaticism stems primarily from the existence of extensions, those handy little next-door neighbors of the Omnibox that save an unbelievable amount of time on routine tasks (both Diigo and Buffer have handy ones). Seriously. If you don't, you'll go down the rabbit hole and never come back. Scroll through your list of new posts in FlowReader, using Ctrl + click on the title to open the posts that look interesting in new tabs. When you open several at a time this way, you don't have to click back to FlowReader in between. After opening five-ish posts, if you're on a Chromebook (like I usually am), use the 3-finger slide on the trackpad to move over a tab. If not, use Ctrl + Tab to cycle through your tabs. Close tabs you don't need. If you scan the blog and it doesn't look useful, use Ctrl + W to close that tab and you'll automatically move to the next one. If the post is a good resource, bookmark it in Diigo. Use Ctrl + Alt + D to open the \"Save to Diigo\" dialog box. When you save, make sure you add tags. You can select from the suggested ones or enter your own. If you use a two-word tag, enclose it in quotes ( \"educational technology\") so Diigo knows they belong together. After you enter your last tag, press the spacebar, then use Ctrl + Enter to save the bookmark. Alt + B is the shortcut for the Buffer extension, or you can Buffer any image from the post to share with your tweet. To include an image, right-click on any image in the post (or two-finger tap on a Chromebook), then select \"Buffer this image\" from the pop-up menu. In the dialog box, edit the tweet (add hashtags, remove the default clutter) and use Ctrl + Enter to add the tweet to your queue. This puts it in your Buffer to go out on schedule. You can also choose \"Share Now\" or \"Share Next\" by clicking the blue down arrow next to the \"Add to Queue\" button. Use Ctrl + W to close the tab, then repeat the process with the next post. At the top, make sure it's set to show \"Unread Only,\" then select \"Mark All As Read.\" Refresh the page (F5) to clear everything so it's delightfully pristine and has that new-car smell about it. That's what works for me. What does your workflow look like? I followed a tweet from @Flowreader, I like your workflow, especially the idea of limiting it to 20 minutes. I am going to give that try in my own curation work. Can you explain how the author uses Diigo to organize their resources for later use?",

    "user_prompt": "Can you summarize the different effects of seating positions on group dynamics, as mentioned in the text material? Answer according to: Choosing the right seat can be a tricky thing, but being aware of the different effects each sitting position sets you ahead of anybody else who is oblivious to it.\nAs a child, I never questioned why my father would sit at the head of the table during family dinners. For unknown reasons, my mother would sit next to my father in the corner position compared to some parents who will usually sit at opposite sides of the dining table. For most parts of our lives, we have been exposed to group setting dynamics, beginning with our family. But as we grow up, we sometimes lose our way in the unspoken rules of seating protocols.\nWhenever we walk into a meeting room, the first decision we make is where to sit. Often this decision is taken on the whim, not given much thought about our seat positioning and how it might initiate different reactions from people around us. For marketing executives, choosing the right seat can help or hurt your chance of success in meetings. In this article, we look at how table shapes influence our psychology, followed by seating positions that reflect your goals and working modes.\nResearch shows that round tables reduce loneliness. That is the reason why Starbucks put round tables in their retail locations worldwide to make customers feel at home when they are alone. Presumably, this effect inspires comfort which makes customers buy more. Restaurants try a slightly different approach to keep the balance of customers who enjoy their meals and the prospect of more paying customers. They use uncomfortable chairs so customers won\u2019t stay too long, vacating their seats for other paying customers. Another study shows that participants are more likely to judge the workspaces as beautiful, softer, and more pleasant if the furniture were curvilinear than rectilinear. That means curved desks make people happier.\nOne of the legends of King Arthur was The Knights of the Round Table who sat at a round table in Camelot. Every knight was considered equal to his peers in honour and title, and there was no central, dominant position. A round table creates an atmosphere of relaxed informality and is ideal for brainstorming because it encourages the free flow of ideas by everyone.\nThis refers to the traditional boardroom table with two short and two long ends. At the short ends of the table, you will find the most influential people. Since people sit opposite each other, the table act as a barrier between them, setting the mood of competition and confrontation. The more powerful person of the short end is the one facing the door because he or she gets the best vantage point of whoever enters or exits the door.\nThese tables are often seen at cafes and restaurants to give a relaxed, and comfortable feel. However, this type of table can be used for business meetings or formal discussions. Similar to the round table, to create a power seat, move the chair slightly back. If you don\u2019t need the seats next to you, remove them.\nSo now let\u2019s weight in on seating positions.\nYou are thinking of keeping your client nearby but not too close, then sitting at the corner position is the most suitable for relaxed and informal conversations. The corner of the table serves as a subtle barrier between two persons, and yet, enough room for gesturing and maintains a comfort zone; is ideal for meeting clients for the first time where you want a non-confrontational setting to build rapport and familiarity.\nWhen you want to amplify your cooperative spirit, sitting side by side at the table says \u201cwe are working on the same team\u201d. Being on the same side of the table creates a feeling of mutual interest and effort. In a sense, your client looks at things from the same perspective as you, and it helps establish a more intimate bond. Next time, sit side by side with your clients while reviewing your marketing plan and see how they respond to you.\nIn this seating position, the table serves as a barrier and shield for each person on each side. It is ideal for serious talks, interviews, and evaluative situations, where the table helps to create \u2019emotional distance.\u2019 This seating position tends to make meetings short and efficient, ideal for making pitches and closing deals.\nThis seating position has a lot of distance and poses an uneasy angle to maintain eye contact, which makes it uncomfortable for communication. What this position says to others is indifference, lack of interest or hostility towards others around. Avoid sitting diagonally to your client in meetings unless you are an assistant to your boss or plan to sneak out early.\nChoosing the right seat can be a tricky thing, but being aware of the different effects each sitting position sets you ahead of anybody else who is oblivious to it. It might not sound like a big issue but getting this step right means setting the right conditions to your purpose from the start.\nResearch shows more deals are made when one sits to the left of a potential client. So make sure you are in the winner seat the next time you go for a meeting.",

Regardless, the benches of the court were not appeased by his heretical and invidious theories, most explicitly outlined in the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, and he spent the rest of his life under house arrest, until his death in 1642.\nGalileo\u2019s oppressors may have succeeded in resigning the man to the confines of a Florentine reformatory, but they had not extinguished his devotion to the pursuit of astrological truth. On being transferred to his new prison, he is believed to have uttered the now timeless words \u201cand yet it moves,\u201d (E pur si muove), under his breath.\nNot long after Galileo died, a Spanish painter, believed to be Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo, decided to include the infamous expression on a depiction of Galileo incarcerated in his prison cell. In 1911, the painting was acquired by Jules van Belle of Roeselare, Belgium. Since that time, however, it has vanished from sight.\nToday, Galileo marks the pages of Europe\u2019s encyclopedia in a much more extraterrestrial nature.\nThe modern \u2018Galileo\u2019 is the name for Europe\u2019s Global Navigation Satellite System, widely touted as a major player in the US GPS, China BaiDou and Russia GLONASS tribrid. Galileo has been operational since 2016, offering localisation and timing services to approximately 400 million users.\nGalileo has grand aspirations. By the end of 2020, the hope is that the system will reach full operational capacity, attempting to obtain a record precision rate of 20cm.\nIf Galileo were to meet this target, it would become the most precise satellite navigation system in the world.\nThe EURACTIV offices recently played host to a high-level group of experts who came together to discuss the future potential of the Galileo system.\nMeanwhile, Alessandro Coda, chief technology officer at the European Association of Automotive Supplies told EURACTIV that Galileo\u2019s 2020 targets will help to substantiate a broader claim for Europe to become the home of autonomous driving, and could also revolutionise the motoring industry.\nWith the Galileo operation set to be complete by the end of the decade, the system could transform an array of technologies and services, such as rescue searches, smart watches, farming, and plane navigation systems, utilizing satellites in ways that the most prominent scientists of yesteryear could never have foreseen.\nIn 1992, before the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in Rome, Pope John Paul II officially declared Galileo\u2019s (the physicist) verisimilitude, thereby admitting the Church\u2019s error in imprisoning him.\nAs for the Galileo satellite system, an apology it may not quite be, but Europe\u2019s demonization of the great physicist and the collective guilt that subsequently followed may have just resulted in one of the greatest technological developments in the history of our continent.\nIt is that time of the year again: G20 leaders gather for their annual meet-up, this time in Argentina. US President Trump has shaken up the summit before landing in Buenos Aires, cancelling a scheduled meeting with Russia\u2019s Vladimir Putin and bragging about tariffs imposed on China.\nWhile some made the headlines for their clothes or were overheard in polite rebukes, others where way too happy to see each other.\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel on the other hand had an unpleasant start and was forced to switch planes half way over the Atlantic.\nThe Ukraine conflict is not in Russia\u2019s interest, long-serving Russian ambassador to the EU, Vladimir Chizhov, told EURACTIV. Meanwhile, tensions in the Asov Sea continue.\nCyberattacks on communication networks and critical infrastructures have also become an increasing military threat. NATO\u2019s biggest cyber defence exercise held in Estonia this week aims to prep its cyber warriors for zero-hour.\nIn a landmark move, the UK intelligence services unveiled the process by which they decide to disclose security vulnerabilities to technology firms.\nAlthough Italy is one step closer to an EU budget procedure, the country\u2019s deputy PM said he is confident about the continuing talks.\nWe won\u2019t be blackmailed by May\u2019s \u2018no deal\u2019 threat, Scotland\u2019s External Relations Minister Fiona Hyslop told EURACTIV.\nAs the European Commission unveiled its long-term vision for greenhouse gas reduction, a yellow cloud hung over the grand pronouncements. Arriving in Brussels, the protest did not stay peaceful and caused some more fuel-related incidents.\nWatch this week\u2019s edition of Tweets of the Week, with Brexit fatigue setting in swiftly, climate targeting net-zero by 2050, and no show Zuckerberg looking incredibly shifty.\nSpeaking of, the EU\u2019s Commissioner for climate action and energy had an unpleasant message for the gas industry when he presented the European Commission\u2019s 2050 vision for a \u201cclimate neutral\u201d economy earlier this week.\nThe G20 leaders\u2019 summit continues in Buenos Aires, will arguably be the most complicated gathering since the most powerful nations started to meet in 2008.\nEarn cash in doing Emini S&P trading the easiest way and learning the correct strategies of how to do it.

    "user_prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What should gardeners do to their feral plants if they are not flowering?\n\nPassage: HAVE you noticed the change in the weather? Particularly late in the afternoon, it feels a little warmer, and to me that has always been the sign to begin preparing for spring. With plants like Grevilleas and Bottlebrushes in full bloom already I think spring has sprung.\nAugust is always the month when you should get ready for the coming growing season, when the garden is bursting into life with colour and vitality. Most annual gardens should once again be seeing the results of careful culture of those annual flowerbeds literally bursting into colour. Annual gardeners will now need a good fertiliser, such as Q-5, around the plants. Remember to cut all spent blooms off your garden plants to increase flower production.\nThis is a very busy time for tub plant enthusiasts, as it is probably one of the best times of the year to start potting and repotting many of your tubbed plants. For plants around the pool, pergola, veranda and even the hanging baskets, that are starting to look a little tired after winter, this is the perfect time to plant them into a larger tub, so that you get the attractive new growth and blooms for spring.\nIt is also time for herbaceous perennials to be lifted, divided and replanted. This would include plants such as Agapanthus, Cannas and Spider Lillies. When replanting, make sure the raised beds are well mulched and the soil used contains at least 50% vegetable matter. Even some cow manure would help. A word of warning - when you divide Agapanthus, they may take two to three years to reach flowering maturity again. Gerbera enthusiasts will now find the green light is there to start dividing the plants to give that best summer display.\nFeral plants of the gardens, such as Bougainvilleas, Hibiscus and Calliandras to name a few, can be cut back, especially if they are not flowering. Pruning of most garden plants can be commenced this month. Poinsettias can be pruned hard now, although if you would like to develop your plant into a taller screening plant, simply cut back to three buds on each plant.\nFor those gardeners with native plants, you should be tip pruning at every opportunity, as the dry weather should bring out spectacular flowering displays. If your native plants have become long and spindly, now is the time to be brutal and cut them back to a stump, within 300mm or one foot from the ground. Don't forget to use a tree wound dressing on the freshly cut wounds to prevent borers from attacking these plants. Importantly, roses will also need to be pruned now, as leaving it much later than the end of this month would be to the detriment of the plant.\nTop dressing of the lawn could also be started now. Now this does not mean to go and put on a large volume of soil above the grass level. It is more a process of just filling in the gaps between the runners and your lawn. Vigilance will be needed in watching for the fungal disease Dollar Spot, which spreads rapidly with foggy, dewy mornings and warm days.\nThe only other important thing to remember with August the month always deliveries strong winds that seem to make almost every plant in the garden want to bend down to the ground. So keep an eye on any of the shrubs that are starting to produce massive new growth as these may need to be tip-pruned. In some cases even having a point to which they can be fixed, either by putting in a few garden stakes, or even just having another plant that they can be loosely tied during that troublesome time.\nThis weekend also has a number advantages for Rockhampton Garden Competition entrants as those final changes to the garden before the judges arrive in about 10 days' time. If you have not entered the Rockhampton Garden Competition you have until this Thursday to enter. Entry forms can be found online at ww.rrc.qld.gov.au or by contacting your local Rockhampton Regional Councillor.",

    "user_prompt": "An analysis, or to analyze, means to examine all the essential parts of something as a means for understanding the thing as a whole. In this essay, you will examine as many aspects of your chosen academic or professional discourse community as possible as a way of understanding it as completely as possible. This essay will prepare you to engage deeply with the conventions and genres of the discourse community in your Annotated Bibliography, and in your final paper, the Genre Adaptation.\nThe term discourse community links the terms discourse, a concept describing all forms of communication that contribute to a particular way of thinking, and community, which in this case refers to the people who use, and help create, a particular discourse. We will focus on formal (academic and professional) discourse communities in this class.\nFirst, identify a formal (professional or academic) discourse community you are interested in researching and writing within this semester. ***I strongly recommend choosing one within your major unless you have a good reason not to.*** Some examples to help guide you are below.\nDont forget that discourse communities may be relatively small (e.g. Kindergarten teachers licensed in Utah) or relatively large (K-12 educators) and that some discourse communities fit within other discourse communities. Its up to you to decide how broad or narrow a scope you want to pursue. My advice is to avoid going too broad (too much to learn and write about within the scope of this class) and too narrow (there may be insufficient genres to study or too few resources to learn enough about it in time).\nFirst, define your discourse community in one or two sentences.\nWhat people/professions belong to the community?\nWhat type of community is it? Formal? Informal? Both? In what way(s)?\nWhere do members do what they do?\nIs your community defined by geography? By institution (university, hospital, corporation)?\nWhen does the community meet (formally, as through local and national conferences, trade shows, community meetings, etc.)?\nWhen does it transmit information? How does it transmit information?\nWhat are its goals and/or aims?\nHow does the community meet its goals and/or aims?\nWhat are some other related discourse communities?\nDoes it belong to a larger discourse community?\nAre there notable sub-communities within your discourse community?\nOther important information about your discourse community may arise as you answer these questions. You should feel free to include this in your analysis.\nNext, Include an analysis of at least four (4) of the formal genres your discourse community uses.\nFirst, identify four (4) or more genres your discourse community uses as a primary mode of communication: some examples include books (textbooks? novels? scholarly?), newspapers, journals, magazines, newsletters, blogs (professional rather than informal or personal), etc.\nWhy does your discourse community use this genre?\nWhen do they use it?\nWhat style and format is it in?\nWhere is it typically published and distributed?\nHow timely is it\u2013is it published immediately upon completion, or does it take time to go through a peer-review cycle, for instance?\nWhat is the aim of the genre?\nHow does it fit the communitys needs?\nInclude some of your own commentary and analysis of the discourse community. Discuss some things you discovered and/or learned during the research process. Discuss how your research has changed or altered your perception of the community. Discuss reasons why you believe this community follows the genre conventions and formats you discovered and what this tells you about what your community considers to be important. How does research into a discourse community, including its genres and conventions, help to shape one's understanding of the community and its priorities?",

The result is Starfish Top 10 Sustainable Fish, a book we are exceptionally proud of which won the Sunday Times Cookbook of the Year.\nFrom snoek, to farmed kabeljou and trout, oysters, mussels, yellowtail, anchovies, sardines, hake and squid, Daisy put time into getting to know each species and how best to cook them. The results are simultaneously enlightening and mouth-watering. To give you a taster, we\u2019ve selected her Salt and Pepper Squid recipe.\nThe best way to do this is to bash together the salt and pepper in a pestle and mortar. It really does improve the taste. If you don\u2019t have one, just add the salt and milled black pepper to the cornflour in a flat dish.\nEmpty your squid into a sieve. Clean it until the water runs clear. Press the squid, getting out as much water as you can. Now add the squid to the seasoned cornflour and mix thoroughly until all the pieces are coated. Try to prevent the tentacles from getting into a big tangled lump.\nGet the children and pets out of the kitchen, make sure you\u2019re wearing an apron and stand way back as you add half the squid to the pan with a slotted spoon. It will spit. I\u2019m going to ask you to resist the temptation to add all the squid to the pan. I know it\u2019s hard. But if you do the squid in two batches it will cook faster and go a beautiful golden colour. If you add it all now the temperature of the oil will drop and the cooking will take longer.\nWhen the squid is golden, lift it out with a slotted spoon and drop it onto kitchen towel. Sprinkle with a little cayenne pepper, if using, and squeeze over a bit of lemon. Once that\u2019s done, you should be able to put in your second batch. It will be cooked in a flash. Eat immediately with extra lemon and something for dipping \u2013 preferably smoked paprika and garlic mayonnaise (recipe page 312).",

The first of three stateside performances, the Lebanese-British singer-songwriter is promoting his upcoming fourth album, No Place in Heaven (out June 16).\nWith an amped up audience, Mika then segued into current single, \u201cTalk About You.\u201d He smartly sandwiched cuts from his new album between fan favorites. Out of the new tunes, the crowd was most responsive to \u201cLast Party,\u201d a tribute to one of his idols, Freddie Mercury. By the end of the melancholy power ballad, the crowd was singing along -- a testament to Mika\u2019s knack for writing earworms. In fact, the audience even joined in to sing the Latin-infused \u201cBoum Boum Boum.\u201d The song, which was a hit in French and Belgium, lacks an English translation.\nThe only low note of the evening was that the venue didn\u2019t suit such an animated personality. Constricted to a small stage with shoddy lighting, Mika wasn\u2019t able to bring the antics that usually make his performances truly magical. His star still shined bright however; the unfortunate staging didn\u2019t affect his stellar chops or his ability to seamlessly transition in and out of falsetto.\nMika will continue his sold out mini-tour on Monday (May 4) at Webster Hall in New York City, and finish in at the Belasco Theater Los Angeles on Wednesday (May 6).",

    "user_prompt": "Given the text: (Crain's) -- Rupert Murdoch has approached Tribune Co. about buying Newsday, according to a report on Crain's NewYorkBusiness.com, a sister site of ChicagoBusiness.com.\nAccording to one newspaper industry insider, the News Corp. chairman, who's still digesting Dow Jones & Co., has made a bid for the Long Island paper, which also owns amNew York, a daily tabloid handed out free in New York City.\nTalk of the bid has surfaced at the same time that Tribune's new CEO Sam Zell has said that an advertising downturn is forcing him to consider selling off company assets. Additionally, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services lowered its corporate credit rating on the media company to B- from B this week.\nMr. Zell today reported a fourth-quarter loss of $78 million, and said the company has \"begun a strategic review\" of Tribune assets -- a sentiment he expressed to Baltimore Sun employees last week.\n\"Our goal when we started this adventure was to keep all the assets together,\" he said to the employees. \"We also started with the assumption that print [advertising] would be down two or three percent this year, not 18%.\"\nTribune revenue dropped 12% to $1.27 billion in the fourth quarter, as advertising and broadcast sales slumped, it reported today.\nAlso today the company disclosed for the first time that it shed 700 jobs last quarter. That's in addition to the 400 to 500 jobs that are slated for elimination company-wide this year, a spokesman said.\nMr. Zell financed his $8.2 billion buyout of Tribune last year almost entirely with debt, leaving the company with a total debt load of around $13 billion. Selling assets could reduce that leverage, he said today.\nNewsday had advertising revenue of $480 million in 2007, down 8% from the prior year, according to TNS Media Intelligence.\nMr. Murdoch has long had an interest in Newsday. A year ago, around the time that Tribune was exploring a sale of the entire company, he tried to establish a joint operating agreement between the Tribune paper and News Corp.'s New York Post. He told analysts and others that the agreement would create \"a very, very powerful combination for advertisers\" and turn the money-losing Post into a viable business \"in five minutes.\"\nTribune, however, was not interested in deals involving individual papers.\nMedia observers say a deal would make sense for both sides.\n\"Why wouldn't Zell sell Newsday, if it could be a de-leveraging event?\" said an investment banker who has worked on newspaper deals.\nHe added, \"News Corp. has the New York Post and the Wall Street Journal. It could start to monopolize New York.\"\nTribune is currently working on a sale of the Chicago Cubs, the baseball team's home stadium, Wrigley Field, and a stake in a cable sports channel. In addition to Newsday and the Sun, Tribune's string of daily newspapers includes the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune. It also owns television stations, including WPIX in New York.\nCiting company policy, a Tribune spokesman declined to comment on a possible News Corp. bid for Newsday.\nA News Corp. spokesman said he knew nothing about any bid for Newsday.\nWhat is the potential impact of a deal between News Corp. and Tribune on the media industry, specifically in New York?",

So far, 12,303 cases had been confirmed.\nThe bacteria quickly dehydrates people as they vomit and expel watery diarrhea, and can kill within four hours. Although treatment is relatively simple \u2014 oral rehydration solutions or intravenous fluids \u2014 it must be administered quickly.\nThe disease spreads through contaminated water, and Haiti's public water system is one of the worst in the world. Few people have adequate latrines, and most rely on well water and surface water that is regularly polluted by their waste.\nAt a hospital in a slum of Gonaives last week, many of the victims said they drank local well water.\n\"The voodoo priest is where I get my water, in buckets,\" said Valerie Marie Cam, whose 3-year-old son was sitting on her lap, hooked up to an IV. \"I usually put two drops of Clorox in it, but today I didn't have any.\"\nThe source of the cholera is unknown. Haiti has not had the disease for at least 50 years, and some scientific literature suggests the nation had not had a major outbreak since the 19th century.\n\"No one alive in Haiti has experienced cholera before, so it's a population which is very susceptible to the bacteria,\" World Health Organization spokesman Gregory Hartl said. \"Cholera, now that it is in Haiti, probably the bacteria will be there for a number of years to come. It will not go away.\"\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: What challenges does Haiti face in terms of its public water system and sanitation infrastructure?",

    "user_prompt": "Can you summarize the main message and emotional themes of the poem that the author wrote during a challenging period of their life? Answer according to: I have been recovering materials that I wrote and posted over the years on the web site I operated until 2014 when it got hacked and turned into a phishing site and got shut down.\nThere are some things I\u2019ve salvaged and this is one of them. It\u2019s just a copy of a poem I\u2019d written. It is about sorrow and was written in the Fall of 2013. I was going through challenging times following a move, some personal stuff and inability to find work due to my limited French speaking abilities. When I wrote this poem I had no idea it would be a prophetic message, a precursor to the sorrow that would enter my heart and soul in May 2014. That was when my brother took his own life; the brother who was the reason I moved to where I am now.\nI had lost other family members before him and it was hard. I was not prepared for the darkness that would settle in, but I allowed everything to come and go as and when it wanted. I no longer tried to stifle the tears, stop the sobs or apologize for not wanting to be around anyone.\nIn looking back at this poem and at the years 2014 until December 2017 when I came back on line and began writing again, I see that I have wept a few rivers and in those tears and rivers of water, I feel like I have been washed clean.\nI have a new love and appreciation for what is now written through these fingers, and am hoping a keener awareness that Spirit sometimes has me write these things to prepare me for what is to come.\nIf you have lost someone or are concerned about someone because of their lifestyle, may you take comfort from these words and know, as I now know so deeply, that Spirit is forever watching over you and me and that Spirit clearly does see the \u201cbig picture\u201d and what\u2019s coming down the pipeline.\nPay attention and then seek guidance from Spirit as to how to prepare for whatever it may be. If you are drawn to a certain object, a certain story or poem, investigate them for their qualities and messages.",

There is no mention in the Kentucky tax records after 1900.\nRon and Elise purchased the property in 2010. With the help of several very skilled contractors and laborers over a hard work-filled three years, the current structure was completed. The Ruin Bed and Breakfast was opened in 2015.\nSince the structure had been derelict for several years, the stone walls had to be repointed and the interior totally gutted. The interior was built re-purposing a lot of the old lumber in addition to wood and materials from other reclamation projects. Some of the material used includes old fence boards, old tobacco barn siding, beams from a railroad warehouse as well as the flooring from an old tobacco warehouse in Louisville. Hand-hewn logs and flooring from a 1780s cabin on Pisgah Pike make up one of the most stunning interior features.\nPhil Gerrow of Midway Preservation was the main craftsman behind this project along with Wilmes Architects who designed the rooms and guest house.\nQuiet and secluded, the property is located across the road from Ashford Stud, home to Triple Crown winner and Champion American Pharoah, three miles from Woodford Reserve and four miles from downtown Versailles, Kentucky.

    "user_prompt": "Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What happened to rival Toyota's TS030 during the race? And, what difficulties did they face in making repairs to their cars?\n\nPassage: In an historic first, an Audi R18 E-Tron Quattro became the first hybrid to win the 24 Hours of Le Mans endurance race. A second hybrid followed the winning car to the podium, while a conventional, diesel-powered Audi placed third.\nFittingly Audi No. 1, driven by the team of Marcel Fassler, Andre Lotterer, and Benoit Treyuler, came first, completing 378 laps in 24 hours. The No.2 Audi, driven by Rinaldo Capello, Tom Kristensen, and Alan McNish, placed second.\nLe Mans is one of oldest, and most challenging, races on the international circuit. As a 24-hour endurance race, it puts drivers\u2019 stamina to the test.\nA few mistakes nearly cost the Audi No.1 team the win. Fassler spun the car in the 14th hour, giving the lead to McNish. He later drove into the gravel, damaging the R18\u2019s rear bodywork. Treyuler also spun the car, in the 21st hour. McNish hit a wall in his No.2 car, causing some bodywork damage.\nAudi was not the only car company to field a hybrid at the 2012 24 Hours of Le Mans. Unfortunately, rival Toyota\u2019s TS030 was plagued by crashes. At the end of the fifth hour, Toyota No. 8 was bumped by another car, sending it flying into the tire barrier. The race was stopped for 75 minutes to clean up the wreckage. \u201cWell that was a big one! Lying in a French hospital with a broken back,\u201d driver Anthony Davidson tweeted after suffering fractures to two vertebrae.\nToyota\u2019s other car was pulled out of the race after Kazuki Nakajima collided with the Nissan DeltaWing during a pass attempt. Toyota\u2019s mechanics couldn\u2019t fix car No. 7, and the team was out of the race by the 11th hour.\nThe winning Audi hybrid is based on the R18 TDI that won Le Mans in 2011, and placed third in this year\u2019s race. The R18 E-Tron Quattro is powered by a 3.7-liter turbodiesel V6, assisted by an electric motor. The diesel powers the rear wheels, while the electric motor powers the fronts. Unlike most hybrids, which carry heavy batteries to store their electricity, the R18 uses a spinning flywheel to keep the juice flowing.\nHybrid systems gave Audi and Toyota a couple of competitive advantages. Electric power cuts fuel consumption, meaning fewer pit stops. The electric motors\u2019 low-end torque also helped the cars accelerate faster out of corners. Racing hybrids also draw attention to both companies\u2019 numerous production hybrids.\nHowever, it\u2019s hard to say whether hybrids will take over racing. With 2009 winner Peugeot out of the running, Audi lacked a serious competitor. The third place-finishing R18 Ultra actually set the fastest time, and pitted the same amount of times as the No. 2 E-Tron Quattro.",

    "user_prompt": "Generate response to the question/instruction based on a piece of given material\n\nQuestion/Instruction: What are some of the main differences between the new S63 AMG and other recently introduced S-class models?\n\nGiven material: Mercedes-Benz has officially revealed its new 577bhp S63 AMG ahead of a planned public debut for the rapid luxury saloon at the Frankfurt motor show in September.\nDistinguished from other recently introduced new S-class models by a number of traditional AMG styling tweaks, including a deep new front bumper, heavily chromed blade grille, 'twin-turbo V8' badges along its flanks and beefed up sills among other changes, the new S63 AMG is planned to go on sale globally in rear-wheel drive guise only next year.\nBuilding on initiatives taken with the standard S-class, the performance variant of the big Mercedes-Benz saloon benefits from a further range of weight saving measures, including the adoption of a 78Ah lithium-ion battery and a spare wheel recess made of carbonfibre.\nIn long wheelbase guise, the new rear-wheel drive S63 AMG is said to weigh 1995kg \u2013 100kg less than its predecessor, despite a moderate increase in dimensions and greater level of standard equipment. Significantly, Mercedes-Benz claims the four-wheel drive S63 AMG hits the scales at the very same figure of 1995kg, owing in part to a more straightforward suspension design.\nPower comes from a reworked version of AMG\u2019s twin-turbocharged 5.5-litre V8 engine that in a departure to recent AMG practice is planned to be offered in just a single state of tune. It develops an added 14bhp over the old S63 AMG with performance package at 577bhp, providing the new car with a power-to-weight ratio of 289bhp per tonne mated to the AMG\u2019s seven-speed MCT (multi clutch transmission) with three driving modes: Controlled Efficiency, Sport and Manual \u2013 the former of which brings an automatic stop/start function for added fuel savings.\nDespite the various weight-saving measures and added power, Mercedes-Benz\u2019s official performance claims for the new rear-wheel-drive S63 AMG put its 0-100kph acceleration at the same level as its predecessor at 4.4sec, while top speed remains limited to 250kph in standard guise and 300kph in combination with an optional driver\u2019s package.\nFollowing moves with other recent new AMG models, a new four-wheel-drive S63 AMG 4Matic model will join the line-up in selected left-hand-drive markets. However, Mercedes-Benz\u2019s continued inability to provide right-hand-drive compatibility with its four-wheel drive system in many models means it will not be sold in the 83 right-hand-drive markets worldwide. With added off-the-line traction, the S63 AMG 4Matic is claimed to storm to 100kph from standstill in just 4.0sec \u2013 an improvement of 0.5sec on the old model.\nThe new S63 AMG is underpinned by a retuned version of the standard S500\u2019s air suspension complete with Mercedes-Benz\u2019s innovative new Magic Body Control system. It employs a camera mounted within the windscreen to scan the road and alter the settings of the air springs, according to the conditions for maximum levels of comfort or sportiness, depending on the chosen mode.\nMercedes' S63 AMG 4Matic boasts a more sporting suspension set-up with conventional steel springs and Mercedes-Benz\u2019s new ADS Plus adaptive damping system, providing continuous adjustment of the dampers in two modes: Comfort and Sport. It also receives revised geometry, with added camber and a larger anti-roll bar up front along with a stiffer sub-frame at the rear.\nThe standard 19-inch forged aluminium wheels on both the rear- and four-wheel drive mode measure 8.5 inches in width up front and 9.5 inches at the rear and comes shod with 255/45 and 285/40 profile tyres respectively. Optional 20-inch wheels will be available in the same width with 255/40 and 285/35 profile rubber.\nFurther options for S63 AMG also include carbon ceramic brakes for the first time among an extensive list of other high-end extras.",

    "user_prompt": "Riding a nine-game winning streak, Mervo has been one of the area's best teams in the second half.\nAll season, Lake Clifton has been streaky. But the No. 13-ranked Lakers have begun to show signs of consistency, and yesterday they upset the host and No. 5 Mustangs, 70-58, in a Baltimore City East Division contest.\nThe win clinches second place in the East for the Lakers (10-5, 5-1), whose only league setback was to No. 1 Dunbar last month. Mervo's last loss came against City on Dec. 22.\nJunior guard Teoine Carroll scored 20 points to lead Lake Clifton and Andre Mouzone added 17. Marcus Hatten led all scorers with 33 points for Mervo (15-3, 1-3).\nHatten, a 6-foot-2 All-Met senior guard, had 21 in the second half and had little help outside of Kevin Taylor, who had 10 points.\nThe Lakers received contributions from Kenny Purnell (12 points in second half), Kenneth Baker (nine) and 6-foot-7 junior center Brandon Haughton, who had 16 rebounds to go with eight points.\n\"We're better than what our record shows,\" said Lake Clifton coach Herman Harried. \"Unfortunately, we go up and down at times. We can turn it on when we need to, but this is a big win for us.\"\nTrailing by 11 midway in the second quarter, Lake Clifton closed the half with a 17-5 run to take a one-point halftime lead. It blew it open with 13 straight points early in the third quarter.\nHarried decided to go with four guards and Haughton in the middle in the second quarter. With Haughton commanding the boards, helping to start transition with outlet passes, and a harassing defense, Lake Clifton showed it will have to be reckoned with when the state 4A North regional playoffs begin later this month.\nHatten tried to bring the Mustangs back, getting a steal and dunk, to close the margin to 45-36 with 1: 30 remaining in the third quarter. Hatten was 13-for-37 from the field, but the rest of the team shot 10-for-41.\n\"We're a finely-tuned team and when we don't get contributions from everybody, it's difficult for us to win, especially against a well-prepared team like Lake Clifton,\" said Mervo coach Woody Williams, whose team had 22 turnovers. Can you provide a summary of the basketball game between Mervo and Lake Clifton, including the key players and their performances?",

    "user_prompt": "Here is a piece of text: EMC also announced what Emsley called the first tapeless virtual tape library for use in IBM zSeries mainframe environments.\n\u201cA lot of people forget the mainframe is still alive and well,\u201d Emsley said, and that most mission-critical applications are still run in a mainframe environment.\nThe Disk Library for Mainframe, or DLm, is entirely disk-based, unlike existing disk-tape hybrid virtual tape libraries. It connects to the zSeries through FICON or ESCON channels, unlike newer generations of tape.\nTape use is more challenging in the mainframe world as opposed to open systems, Emsley said. Tape is used as a medium for production data and batch reporting, so its reliability doesn\u2019t just affect backup, but also the production environment.\nAnd there\u2019s a reliability issue with the magnetic medium. \u201cThey fail,\u201d Emsley said. \u201cBad media is bad news.\u201d They can get lost and incur transport costs to restore. Tape is also becoming a scarcer commodity on the market, he said.\nThe DLm uses 1TB SATA II drives with RAID 6 protection. Emsley said the library can scale to 190TB of usable capacity. With mainframe hardware compression for backup at a ratio of about 2.5 to one, that\u2019s half a petabyte of storage, Emsley said. And the DLM delivers throughput of up to 600 Mbps.\nOnce full, a loaded DLm can be replicated over IP to another DLm.\n\nBased on the text material above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Does the DLm provide hardware compression for backup, and how much throughput is delivered?",

Answer according to: DAVIE\u2014Cody Parkey demands that you stop what you\u2019re doing immediately and vote for him to make the Pro Bowl.\nMaybe demands was too strong of a word.\nAnyway, the mild-mannered kicker from Jupiter has had a good year. He\u2019s 13 for 14 on field goals, and it\u2019s not his fault he doesn\u2019t get more attempts. He has no control over that. The Dolphins are first in the NFL in opponent starting field position after kickoffs, and he\u2019s believed to be the only kicker in the league to make good on two onsides kicks this year.\nBack in his Dolphins debut, he walked calmly out to the middle of the field with one minute left and his team down two points and nailed a 54-yard field goal like it was nothing. The legend of The Jupiter Juggernaut was born that afternoon in Los Angeles, and now it\u2019s time for his triumphant return to the Pro Bowl.\nBut he\u2019ll have to beat out New England\u2019s Stephen Gostkowski (leading vote getter) and Indianapolis\u2019 Adam Vinatieri (best percentage). Fan voting ends Thursday\u2014click here to vote\u2014and the rosters are announced Dec. 19 for next month\u2019s game in Orlando.\nAlright, go ahead sell yourself for the Pro Bowl.\nBeing surprised by someone asking you about the Pro Bowl isn\u2019t a good start to campaigning for the Pro Bowl.\nAdam Vinatieri has a higher percentage made. Discredit him. Why is Vinatieri a fraud?\nYou\u2019re not understanding how this works.\nI mean, you sound like you want Vinatieri to get picked.\nNo problem. Stephen Gostkowski, also a fraud.\nYou and Vinatieri made the Pro Bowl in the 2014 season, and you started out with him in training camp with Indy your rookie year. Was he cool?\nWait, you thought you\u2019d beat out Adam Vinatieri?\nYou\u2019re a kid and you thought you\u2019d put Adam Vinatieri in his place.\nWhat was the best part of being in the Pro Bowl?\nDid anybody hand you their dry cleaning? Or were you not allowed in the stadium?\nThe Tennessee game? You\u2019d been the kicker for a month already.\nBack to the Pro Bowl. It\u2019s in Orlando this year. That\u2019s pretty close to home.\nWhy are you not actively campaigning for this? You have a Twitter account.\nYeah, but it\u2019s just stuff about charity events. It\u2019s time to use it for something that matters.\nYou could be the kicker with guns. Like Ed \u201cGuns\u201d Hochuli, but of kickers.\nLast chance to sell yourself to the voters.",

    "user_prompt": "Receiving a diagnosis of a terminal illness is a daunting prospect to face, and most people would simply resign themselves to the time the doctors said they had left and spend the last of their lives not looking for other options, but working their way through their own personal \u201cbucket list\u201d or giving up their will to live. A select few individuals would buck this trend, such as James \u201cRhio\u201d O Connor. He would instead research every alternative, learn everything there is to know about the disease threatening his life, refusing to give up and deciding his own path, by the end of it becoming an inspiration to anyone who faces a seemingly hopeless future after being diagnosed with a terminal illness such as cancer.\nRhio received the rather bleak diagnosis of mesothelioma, a type of cancer that one develops after exposure to asbestos, which is commonly found in the insulation of many older buildings, and causes cancer in the abdominal cavity and/or the lining of the lungs in humans when its dust is inhaled. Since one can be exposed to asbestos for only one or two months in order to contract it and it can lie dormant for decades before becoming symptomatic, it is difficult to diagnose mesothelioma in it\u2019s early stages. Rhio\u2019s prognosis was grim. He was given only a year to live, as mesothelioma has no real cure or treatment, and the conventional treatments such as radiation, chemo, and surgery are ineffective and would cause more pain than benefit. It seemed as if his only option was to hold on as long as he could, and let the cancer run its course.\nInstead, Rhio decided to learn all he could about his disease, poring over books and journals, researching potential treatments, discussing his questions and concerns with medical professionals, and then created his own treatment and selected his own physicians to carry it out. His tenacity and belief in a higher power that had a greater plan for him gave him the strength to pursue a less travelled path and another six years of life. His life should serve as an inspiration to everyone to not give up no matter how bleak the future may look.\nIf I faced the same fate as Rhio O Connor, I hope that I would show the same strength of will and character. After I received my diagnosis, I would learn as much as I could about what was wrong with me, the symptoms and progression of my disease, and what conventional treatments could do for me. If I didn\u2019t think that the normal methods, such as chemo or radiation would help me, I would find out any new or experimental treatments for my cancer and look at the side effects and see if they were worth trying. It would make no sense to try a treatment that would extend my life but leave me too miserable to enjoy it, but if they could improve my health for a while, I would certainly give it a try.\nProbably one of the first and most important things I would do would be to enlist the support of my family to help me search for an effective treatment and help me as I went through it. My mother has always been the one to research any maladies that have afflicted anyone in our family, so she would be my research and treatment partner. She always has a knack of finding things that I don\u2019t, so I know that no stone would go unturned in the search for information on mesothelioma.\nResearching treatments and trying new therapies isn\u2019t the only hard part of cancer. Just as important, if not more so, would be keeping my spirits up. Knowing that Rhio went beyond the conventional treatments and went on to live six years after his diagnosis would be a great source of inspiration to me as I dealt with my own fears about being diagnosed with cancer. The fact that he created his own specific treatment for his cancer would encourage me to go out and explore all of my options, and not to give up on fighting the disease. It would also make me feel better to know that just because I have been given a small amount of time to live doesn\u2019t mean I have to resign myself to the doctor\u2019s prognosis.\nEven though there may not be a cure for a disease, as there isn\u2019t for mesothelioma; the life of James \u201cRhio\u201d O Connor proves that is no reason to stop trying. Rhio knew his disease was terminal, but he fought anyway and extended his life an additional six years, years he wouldn\u2019t have had if he hadn\u2019t decided to become informed about his illness and treatment options, and taken the initiative to take risks and try unexplored territory. His journey through life is an amazing testament to the incredible man he was; and the optimism and strength of spirit he showed is truly miraculous. If anyone could be called an inspiration to others, it would have to be James \u201cRhio\u201d O Connor. Based on the passage above, Can you summarize the story of James \"Rhio\" O'Connor and his battle with mesothelioma?",

    "user_prompt": "No web browser is fully secure and research shows that vulnerabilities in web browsers are a target for hackers and criminals. Patching your browser will reduce the risk of a security breach. And there is good reason why. In 2011, as in 2010, web browsers had the higher number of security vulnerabilities reported compared to other applications. And these vulnerabilities can be used to target web servers, web applications and end-user machines, thus the considerable interest around them.\nIn 2011, the National Vulnerability Database reported that the top five browsers together had 515 vulnerabilities. This is more than the vulnerabilities reported for all operating systems together and on an ascending trend since 2010, when it was reported that together they had 472 vulnerabilities.\nGoogle Chrome: Security vulnerabilities reported is on a highly ascending path. Google Chrome is the application with highest number of security vulnerabilities reported for the second year in a row. 275 new security vulnerabilities were discovered last year and the number is really impressive. For example, Microsoft \u201conly\u201d had 244 vulnerabilities reported in 2011 in all their products!\nMozilla Firefox: Vulnerabilities reported is on a descending trend after it had a peak in 2009, when it was the application with highest number of vulnerabilities discovered for the year. 97 new security vulnerabilities were discovered last year. This is slightly lower than the 103 vulnerabilities reported in 2010.\nInternet Explorer: Security improvements added in latest versions contributed to the constantly descending number of discovered vulnerabilities in the browser for the past years. 45 new security vulnerabilities were discovered last year in Microsoft Internet Explorer. This is less than the 59 vulnerabilities reported in 2010.\nApple Safari: After the peak it had in 2010, the number of vulnerabilities is lower in 2011. 45 new security vulnerabilities were discovered last year. This is good improvement compared with the 122 vulnerabilities reported in 2010.\nOpera Browser: The number of vulnerabilities reported in 2011 is on an ascending path, but the trend started from low levels and the number of critical vulnerabilities is still way below other browsers. 53 new security vulnerabilities were discovered last year. This is more than the 36 vulnerabilities reported in 2010.\n96% of all vulnerabilities in web browsers were disclosed to public only after a fix was available from the vendor. This indicates that keeping your systems fully patched is crucial to reduce the risks of a security breach caused by a vulnerability in the web browser.\n20 vulnerabilities out of the total of 515 either do not have a fix from vendor at all or it was released after the vulnerability was disclosed to public. These are what security specialists call zero-day vulnerabilities and are usually very dangerous because it is hard or impossible to protect against attacks exploiting vulnerabilities that have no fix available.\nWhile there are some differences in the number of vulnerabilities and exploits for each browser the fact is that there is no such thing as a web browser that\u2019s completely secure and therefore, patching them is one way to lower the risk of a security breach as much as possible.\nAs a Chrome user, these numbers are highly alarming, but when I try to think of the reason for the spike in vulnerabilities, it\u2019s pretty easy to point to the \u201capp store\u201d interface and the move toward cloud-based applications as breaking the hornet\u2019s nest wide open. Still, I didn\u2019t expect the security to be THAT bad.\nThe only reason why Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox are the two of the most vulnerable web browsers today is because they\u2019re the two of the most popular rising browsers today. In IT world, if you are popular and widely used, expect more attacks \u2013 this is how the game works especially to web apps.\nThis is also the reason why Google Chrome and Firefox is two of most updated programs on the World Wide Web. I admit it, I\u2019m a huge fan of Firefox. I\u2019ve been using it since November 2004 \u2013 the browser\u2019s initial release. I found it to be the most secure web browser then and now PERIOD.\nWell, the study shows it. Opera is the most secure and least vulnerable web browser to date. This is the reason why the mobile version of Opera is also the most widely installed and used mobile web browser. Almost 80 million users use Opera Mini.\nIn fact, Opera Mini is the default browser of some of the top smartphones to date \u2013 Samsung Galaxy, Qualcomm, HTC, etc. All these figures just prove that you don\u2019t have to have the backing of a mega company to create an outstanding web browser. What you say Apple and Microsoft?\nWhat\u2019s striking me most is that except Opera, all the other browsers have a lot of severe vulnerabilities. With Firefox I presume this has to do with the rapid release cycle \u2013 I can\u2019t count how many new versions they released in the last couple of years. I have never been a fan of rapid releases but when this is at the expense of security, this is totally wrong for me.\nI wouldn\u2019t worry about Chrome so much, the spike on the first graph is mostly vulnerabilities found by the staff and testers.\nImplying a browser is more or less secure by the initial graph is ignorant, if the staff don\u2019t find bugs in their own software then they could be equally as incompetent as those who introduce the bugs, it can also boil down to prototyping style and release frequency.\nIt\u2019s the last two graphs people should be focusing on. These are the real issues we face every day when browsing. Based on the passage above, Can you summarize the vulnerabilities reported in the top five web browsers in 2011 and how they compare to vulnerabilities in other applications?",

The estimation uses an asset pricing framework based on a habit consumption model together with a joint formulation of consumption growth and inflation. Nominal yields carry a time-varying inflation premium that is significant throughout the period, increasing in the bond's maturity and contributing up to 25 basis points to yearly nominal yields. The analysis allows the extraction of the ex ante real rate from indexed bonds by properly taking into account both the incomplete indexation on these instruments and the inflation premium embedded in the nominal bonds.\nCan you provide a summary of the paper's analysis of bond yields in the United Kingdom from 1983 to 2000?",
