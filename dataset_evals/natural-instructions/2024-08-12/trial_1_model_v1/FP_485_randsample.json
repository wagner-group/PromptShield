Having fully embraced his unholy lineage and run his company for seven years, Damien now attempts to reshape his destiny by halting the Second Coming of Christ. However, Father DeCarlo (Rossano Brazzi), a priest from the Subiaco monastery where Father Spiletto spent his final days and observed Damien from afar since his adopted father's death, acquires the Seven Daggers of Megiddo that were dug out of the ruins of the Thorn Museum in Chicago. Joined by six other priests, DeCarlo plans to kill Damien while finding the Christ Child. Meanwhile, Damien becomes romantically involved with journalist Kate Reynolds (Lisa Harrow). Learning of his assassins and taking out all but DeCarlo over time, he proceeds to mold Reynolds's young son Peter (Barnaby Holm) into a disciple by playing on the boy's desire for a father figure.After the alignment of stars in the Cassiopeia constellation on March 24, 1982, generating what is described as a second Star of Bethlehem, Damien realizes it is a sign of the Second Coming and orders his followers to kill all boys born in England on the morning of March 24, 1982 to prevent the Christ Child's return to power. A week after a string of thirty one infant deaths, Reynolds encounters DeCarlo as he reveals Damien's true identity to her while giving her evidence of the murders. The next day, Damien rapes and sodomises Reynolds. The following morning Reynolds discovers Damien's birthmark. Damien tells Peter to follow DeCarlo, resulting in Damien learning that his advisor, Harvey Dean, had concealed the date of his son's birth when Peter reports DeCarlo visiting Dean's wife Barbara and revealing her husband's role in the infant murders. Dean refuses to kill his son and makes preparations to flee the country, only to return home and be killed by his wife, Barbara, who has fallen under Damien's control and murdered their child.DeCarlo later visits Reynolds and reveals that Peter is now under Damien's influence and that the real Christ Child is now beyond Damien's reach. Agreeing to help DeCarlo, Reynolds tricks Damien with the promise to bring him to the church ruins where the Christ Child is in exchange for Peter. The plan backfires when Damien spots DeCarlo first and uses Peter as a human shield against the dagger. As Peter dies in his mother's arms, Damien throttles Father DeCarlo before calling out for Christ to appear before him and \"face him\". This leaves Damien open to be stabbed in the back by Reynolds using DeCarlo's Megiddo dagger. As Damien staggers through the courtyard and collapses, a vision of Christ appears in the archway above him. Damien scolds Christ for thinking he has won, and then dies. DeCarlo reappears carrying Peter's body and hands him to a praying Kate before they leave the ruins.Revelation chapter 21, verse 4, is seen, indicating that when Christ returns to earth, peace will reign for all who faithfully awaited the Lord's return.",

He is in his early twenties, lives with his parents and he works a low-paid job as a mechanic. Psychologically, he is continually bombarded with the problems of the world, by ubiquitous TV sets, radios, and the views of Evan Drince, a left-wing philosopher who seems to be his sole friend. One day, Bill, after being hurt after his parents tell him that it's time he left home, and tired of being victimized by his nasty boss at work, Bill acts upon his plan to reduce the town's population. He believes overcrowding causes the world's problems.Determined to extract revenge upon his small town where he lives, Bill, builds himself a full-body suit of Kevlar armor, complete with a ballistic helmet and a paintball mask from parts he has had sent to Evan's home over a period of time. Evan lives with his father.One day, Bill dons his suit of Kevlar armor, and goes to town. First he incapacitates the police by car-bombing their headquarters with a bomb-laden van which he drives by remote control. He then begins to kill the town folk, shooting people at random, including the coffee shop owner with whom he earlier had argued about not preparing the coffee as he ordered.Bill enters a beauty salon to take a rest and have a drink of water from his rampage. But then he kills all of the employees and customers (all of them women) in cold blood because he was forced to remove his paintball mask to have some water.Next, in the film's funniest scene, Bill enters a bingo hall where he is hardly noticed by the elderly and senial people... all playing bingo. Out of pity, Bill does not open fire on the senior citizens playing bingo, but instead orders a sandwich and a drink from the concession stand and then walks out of the building, deciding to let the bingo-playing old people live since their lives will end sooner then most others.A little later, Bill robs a bank, killing some of the employees. Outside the bank he puts on a show by burning fake money, which he had printed up earlier, to show that it is worthless and causes the problems of the world. Bill then goes to the fast-food place and kills the countergirl who had clumsily served he and Evan the previous day.Bill then drives out of town with a small group of police in pursuit. But Bill has even more out-of-the-blue tricks up his sleave when he sets off some roadside bombs, destroying the police cars, and drives off the road into the nearby forest, with the sheriff and the last surviving cops in chase. But Bill ambushes and kills them all.After the killings, Bill calls Evan, who is in the forest nearby expecting him for a mano-a-mano paintball competition. When he arrives at the forest, Bill apologizes to Evan for having him wait for an hour. He then immobilizes Evan with a stun gun, places a pistol in his hand, and shoots him in the head to simulate suicide. Bill leaves the body of Evan wearing the armor suit, and holding the weapons of the massacre. He leaves the forest and makes his way home, arriving before his parents arrive with horror stories about the killings in town. After listening to his parents, he retires to his bedroom to sleep.In his room, while packing his belongings and stolen bank money, he hears a local television news report that police believe Evan Drince is the dead perpetrator of the killings and the bank robbery. The police have arrested Evan's father, a well-known extremist and political hack whom they blame for influencing him to carry out this killing spree.In the final scene, the deranged Bill leaves the house of his parents, as told. The story of the mass murder concludes with a video recording of Bill announcing his departure on a personal quest to unknown whereabouts, to further reduce the world's population in more mass shootings and to frame more people he befriends to continue on his evil and misanthropic quest.",

A simple rule of thumb to decide whether a question is a factoid or not is to see if two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage.\nMiriam Blaylock (Catherine Deneuve) is a beautiful and dangerous immortal vampire, promising specially chosen humans eternal life as her vampire lovers. As the film begins, her vampire companion is John (David Bowie), a talented cellist whom she married in 18th century France. The film opens in a night club in New York, to a live performance of Bauhaus playing \"Bela Lugosi's Dead\". There they connect with another young couple who are brought home and fed upon by slashing their throats with a bladed Ankh pendant. The bodies are disposed of by an incinerator in the basement of John and Miriam's elegant New York townhouse, where they pose as a wealthy couple who teach classical music. The only student shown is a young tomboy violinist named Alice Cavender (Beth Ehlers).Periodically killing and feeding upon human victims allows Miriam and John to possess eternal youth or what the latter was led to believe. Approximately 200 years after his turning, John begins suffering insomnia and ages rapidly in only a few days. John realizes that Miriam knew that this would happen and that her promise of \"forever and ever\" was only partially true: he will have eternal life but not eternal youth. Feeling betrayed, he seeks out the help of Dr. Sarah Roberts (Susan Sarandon), a gerontologist, alongside her boyfriend Tom (Cliff De Young), who specialises in studying the effects of rapid aging in primates, hoping she will be able to help reverse his accelerating decrepitude. Sarah assumes that John is a hypochondriac or mentally unbalanced and ignores his pleas for help. As John leaves the clinic in a rage, Sarah is horrified to see how rapidly he is aging. John rebuffs her once she tries to help him.After returning from the clinic, Alice drops by unexpectedly to say that she cannot attend the next day's lesson. While inside, she believes John to be his own father due to the accelerated aging. In a last attempt to regain his youth, John murders and feeds upon Alice, whom Miriam was grooming to be her next consort when she came of age, to no avail. As John's aging advances, he begs Miriam to kill him and release him from the agony of his decrepit body. Weeping, Miriam tells him that there is no release. After John collapses in the basement, Miriam carries him into the attic full of coffins and places him in one, then asks the surrounding ones to \"be kind to him tonight.\" Like John now, Miriam's former vampire lovers are doomed to suffer an eternal living death, helplessly moaning and trapped in their coffins. Later, a police official comes to the Blaylock residence, looking for the missing Alice. Miriam feigns ignorance and claims that her husband is in Switzerland.Sarah comes looking for John at his home but only finds Miriam. With the two women feeling an attraction towards each other, Miriam acts upon this as she now feels alone after losing her lover and the young girl she was grooming. (In a memorable scene during a piano adaptation of The Flower Duet, Sarah says: \"Are you making a pass at me, Mrs. Blaylock?\") The two have a sexual encounter during which, without Sarah being fully aware of it, Miriam bites her arm and a blood exchange occurs in which some of Miriam's blood enters Sarah's body. Miriam attempts to initiate Sarah in the necessities of life as a vampire but Sarah is repulsed by the thought of subsisting on human blood.Sarah returns home and goes out to dinner with Tom, who becomes argumentative about her 3-hour disappearance at the Blaylock residence, of which she is strangely quiet. The next day at the lab, the team investigates Sarah's blood by Tom's authority and reveal she has some kind of infection that is taking over. Confused, Sarah returns to the Blaylock residence to confront Miriam about her sudden changes. Still reeling from the effects of her vampiric transformation, Sarah allows Miriam to put her to bed in a guest room.Shortly afterwards, Tom arrives on Miriam's doorstep, trying to find Sarah. Miriam informs him that Sarah is in the upstairs bedroom. Sarah, starving and desperate, tries to resist the urge to kill Tom but gives in to temptation, when Tom refuses to leave her side. Sarah then joins Miriam by the piano and Miriam assures her that she will soon forget what she was and come to love Miriam. As the two kiss, Sarah drives Miriam's ankh-knife into her own throat, attempting to kill herself as she forcibly holds her mouth over Miriam's mouth, forcing Miriam to ingest her blood, possibly working on a hunch regarding the \"blood borne metabolic aging disease\" and \"host\" relationship she was told about affecting her blood. Miriam carries Sarah upstairs, intending to place her with her other boxed lovers. A rumbling occurs and the mummies of Miriam's previous lovers emerge from their coffins, driving her over the edge of the balcony. As she rapidly ages, the mummies fall and become dust, ostensibly providing the trapped souls with release.As the film draws to a close, the police investigator returns only to find a real estate agent is showing the town house stripped of all possessions to prospective buyers. Sarah is now in London, standing on the balcony of a chic apartment tower (one of the three towers of the Barbican), in the company of an attractive young man and woman and is serenely admiring the gorgeous view as dusk falls. From a draped coffin in a storage room, Miriam repeatedly screams Sarah's name (an overlay of the audio from earlier in the film).Rewritten ending[edit]The final scene of Sarah on the balcony was added at the studio's behest, with a view to leaving the film open-ended and allowing for possible sequels.[2] Sarandon later expressed regret that this sequence seemed to make no sense in the context of the rest of the film: \"The thing that made the film interesting to me was this question of, 'Would you want to live forever if you were an addict?' But as the film progressed, the powers that be rewrote the ending and decided that I wouldn't die, so what was the point? All the rules that we'd spent the entire film delineating, that Miriam lived forever and was indestructible, and all the people that she transformed [eventually] died, and that I killed myself rather than be an addict [were ignored]. Suddenly I was kind of living, she was kind of half dying... Nobody knew what was going on, and I thought that was a shame.\"[3]",

As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event.

Your task is to summarize them.\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) \u2014 The Subway restaurant chain said Friday it received a \"serious\" complaint about Jared Fogle when he was the company's spokesman but that the complaint did not imply any criminal sexual activity. \n  \n The company announced in a statement that it has completed an internal investigation into whether it was alerted to concerns about Fogle, who agreed last month to plead guilty to allegations he paid for sex acts with girls as young as 16 and had received child pornography. The company has severed its ties to him. \n  \n Subway's investigation included a review of more than a million online comments and interviews with past and present employees and managers with both the company and an advertising fund, the statement said. \n  \n Subway spokeswoman Kristen McMahon said the company received the \"serious\" complaint in 2011 from former Florida journalist Rochelle Herman-Walrond, who says she worked with the FBI to record Fogle expressing interest in sex with minors. The company's statement said that while the complaint \"expressed concerns about Mr. Fogle,\" it included \"nothing that implied anything about sexual behavior or criminal activity involving Mr. Fogle.\" McMahon would not elaborate on the nature of the complaint. \n  \n Nevertheless, the company said it regrets the complaint was \"not properly escalated or acted upon,\" according to the statement. \n  \n \"It is important to note that the investigation found no further evidence of any other complaints of any kind regarding Mr. Fogle that were submitted to or shared with SUBWAY,\" the statement said. \n  \n Telephone calls by The Associated Press to Herman-Walrond seeking comment on Subway's statement were not immediately returned Friday night. Fogle's lawyers also did not respond to requests for comment. \n  \n It's unclear how Herman-Walrond knew Fogle, who lives in suburban Indianapolis. Authorities in Indiana would not say whether she was part of their investigation into him. But Fogle's plea agreement mentions that witnesses in Florida, Georgia and Washington state provided recordings and information it says show Fogle \"repeatedly discussed with them his interest in engaging in commercial sex acts with minors or stated that he has done so in the past.\" \n  \n Separately, a lawyer for former Subway franchisee Cindy Mills said she alerted an executive in charge of the company's advertising in 2008 after Fogle began talking to her about paying for sex with minors.

They also reviewed \"all available documents, and interviews with past and present Company and Franchisee Advertising Fund employees and management.\"\"The investigation identified one complaint that was submitted via Subway's website in 2011 that exposed concerns about Mr. Fogle,\" the statement reads. \"Although the complaint was serious, there was nothing that implied anything about sexual behavior or criminal activity involving Mr. Fogle.\"We regret that this comment was not properly escalated or acted upon. When we first learned of the investigation into Mr. Fogle, we immediately suspended and subsequently ended out relationship with him.\"The statement continued, wishing victims and their families the company's \"deepest sympathies\".While Subway reports only one complaint, a former company franchisee claimed that she told the company about Fogle's sexual interest in children as early as 2008, but officials did nothing.The chain restaurant has denied being aware of the claims.Since allegations against Fogle surfaced, the 38-year-old has accepted a plea deal and will serve at least five years in prison, as well as paying $1.4 million in restitution and registering as a sex offender. |||||",

Jack Skellington, a skeleton with the title of \"Pumpkin King\", leads them in organizing the annual Halloween holiday. However, Jack reveals he has grown weary of the same routine year after year, and wants something more. Wandering dejectedly in the woods, he stumbles across seven trees containing doors leading to towns representing various holidays, and accidentally opens a portal to Christmas Town. Impressed by the bright and cheery feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of Christmas, to the Halloween Town residents. However, they fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything to their ideas of Halloween. Jack is dismayed that no one understands the feeling of Christmas, and obsessively studies the holiday but fails to find any further explanation of it. He ultimately decides that it's unfair for Christmas Town alone to enjoy the feeling and announces that he and the citizens of Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year.Jack's obsession with Christmas leads him to usurp the role of \"Sandy Claus\". Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a beautiful rag doll woman, falls in love with Jack. However, after a vision of a burning Christmas tree, she alone realizes that his plans to run Christmas will become disastrous, but has no luck convincing him. Jack assigns Lock, Shock and Barrel, a trio of mischievous trick-or-treating children, to abduct Santa and bring him back to Halloween Town. Against Jack's wishes and largely for their amusement, the trio delivers Santa to Oogie Boogie, a gambling-addict bogeyman, who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake.Christmas Eve arrives and after Sally's attempts to stop Jack fails, Jack departs in a coffin-like sleigh pulled by skeletal reindeer, guided by Zero. Jack begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the Halloween-styled gifts only terrify the recipients. Alerted by his presence, Jack is shot down by the military and crash-lands in a cemetery unharmed. Although he is depressed by the failure of his plan, he quickly regains his old spirit, and returns to Halloween Town to rectify his actions.Meanwhile, Sally attempts to free Santa, but is captured by Oogie. Jack slips into the lair and frees them, then confronts Oogie. Oogie springs several traps on Jack, who manages to dodge them and defeats Oogie before he flees. Jack apologizes to Santa for his actions, and the latter assures him that he can fix things and returns to Christmas Town. The townspeople of Halloween Town celebrate Jack's return, and snow falls over Halloween Town, a sign of reconciliation between Santa and Jack. Atop the graveyard's big hill, Jack admits that he reciprocates Sally's romantic feelings for him, and they declare their love for one another.",

Karswell, noticing the time, ushers Harrington out and telling him he will do all he can.As he arrives home Harrington hears a strange noise and through the night can see a huge demon approaching. He attempts to drive away but reverses his car in to an electricity pole, staggers out of it and is caught in the sparking cables as the demon reaches down to claw at his body.Cut to the interior of an aeroplane where Dr. Holden (Dana Andrews) is attempting to sleep. Over his face is a newspaper and visible is an article headlined \"Prominent Psychologist Flies to London for International Convention\" bears his photograph. In the seat behind him is a young woman -- Joanna Harrington (Peggy Cummins).Holden is met at the airport and discusses the convention he is attending with waiting journalists. Meanwhile Joanna Harrington attempts unsuccessfully to telephone Professor Harrington's house.Holden meets up with two of his fellow delegates Professors Mark O'Brien (Liam Redmond) and K.T. Kumar (Peter Elliot). O'Brien and Holden discuss the case of Rand Hobart (Brian Wilde) -- a member of the Karswell \"devil cult\" which Holden intends to denounce at the conference. Hobart is in a lunatic asylum for murder, although he claims that the killing was done by a demon. Under hypnosis Hobart has produced a drawing of a demon which bears striking similarities to various other drawings of demons produced over the centuries.The telephone rings and it is Karswell, who attempts to warn Holden off.The following morning Holden goes to the reading room of the British Museum, where he discovers that 'The True Discoveries of the Witches and Demons' --- mentioned in Prof. Harrington's notes --- is missing.In the reading room, Karswell approaches him and offers to let Holden use his library of books on witchcraft and demonology --- which includes a copy of 'The True Discoveries of Witches and Demons', inviting him to visit him at Lufford Hall. Karswell gives Holden a card, and \"accidentally\" upsets the papers on his desk, apologises and hands them back to him. He leaves. Holden looks at the card and finds that as well as karswell's name and address it also has \"In memoriam Henry Harrington allowed two weeks\" in glowing letters. He watches Karswell walk away and is suddenly overcome with dizziness and blurred vision. He shows the card to an assistant in the library, but the \"In memoriam...\" text has disappeared. He next takes the card to a chemist (Chalres Lloyd Pack) who can find nothing wrong with the card.Cut to the church in which the funderal of Professor Harrington is being held. Holden and Joanna Harrington recognise each other from the aeroplane. Joanna tells Holden that they must speak and they meet at Holden's hotel that evening. She advises Holden to drop his investigation of the Karswell cult.She reads from her uncle's Diary, where he recounts that Karwell gave him a concert programme which contained a parchment with runes written on it, which acted as if it were alive and flew in to the fire and was burned; and that ever since he has been pursued by strange lights and has had various other signs of the supernatural. The chemist telephones Holden to inform him that the card on which he saw the writing has come back clean: there is no sign of any ink on the card.Holden and Joanna Harrington drive out to Lufford Hall, where they find Karswell performing magic tricks for a group of children. Holden and Karswell talk about 'The True Discoveries of Witches and Demons', which Karswell informs Holden was written in cypher, and that he has de-cyphered. Holden continues to be sceptical, so Karswell offers to conjure a wind-storm. He concentrates for a few seconds and a tremendous storm appears from nowhere.Karswell and Holden run indoors to avoid the storm. Karswell explains to Holden that -- like Prof. Harrington before him -- he has put a curse on him, which will lead to his death three days hence. Meanwhile Karswell's mother (Athene Sayler) is showing Joanna Harrington Karswell's copy of a book (presumably 'The True Discoveries of Witches and Demons'), which neither of them can understand. Holden and Joanna Harrington leave Lufford Hall.Back at the hotel, as Holden walks along the corridor he begins to hear the strange noise which preceded the manifestation of the demon which killed Prof. Harrington but it is interrupted by the door of a room opening. Talking with O'Brien and Kumar, Holden is still sceptical. O'Brien looks in Holden's diary and discovers all the pages after the date which Karswell has arranged for his death have been torn out.Holden has dinner with Joanna at Prof. Harrington's house. Joanna continues to read from her uncle's journal, and Holden discovers that the pages of Prof. Harrington's diary after the date of his death had been torn out. Still sceptical Holden tells Joanna that even if a curse did exist, he couldn't have been subject to it as a paper has to be passed -- secretly -- to the victom of the curse. He goes through the papers in his briefcase and discovers that amongst those returned to him by Karswell in reading room is one bearing a runic script. The paper flies from his hand towards the fire but is stopped by the fire-guard. Holden retrieves it.The following day Holden visits Rand Hobart's -- who are also members of the cult -- family to seek their permission for him to be released from the asylum temporarily to be examined at the conference. Hobart's mother signs the release paper and as he goes to put it in his wallet the runic parchment makes another bid to escape.Holden then arranges to meet Joanna, who has been invited to a seance by Karswell's mother. The seance is run by Mr. Meek (Reginald Beckwith). During the seance, Mr. Meek goes in to a trance and begins to \"channel\" Prof. Harrington who has a message for Joanna that Karswell has successfully translated the book and that the demon is real. Holden leaves the seance in disgust, still refusing to believe that demons exist. Joanna and Holden decide to drive out to Lufford Hall to try and find Karswell's translation of the book. Holden breaks in to Karwell's study, where he is attacked by what appears to be a wild-cat [more accurately, he wrestles with an evidently stuffed cat -- the effects in this bit are less than convincing]. Karswell appears and the \"wild cat\" has now assumed the form of an ordinary cat, and Karswell informs Holden that it is a minor demon.Against Karswell's advice, Holden returns to his car through the woods. On his journey he sees huge smoking footprints appear in the path at his side, followed by a strange smoky apparition and the strange noise. They phenomena disappear. Holden and Joanna go to the police who dismiss them as a pair of cranks.The following morning Holden is having breakfast with Kumar and O'Brien. He refuses to accept a call from Karswell's mother who keeps trying to call him. Karswell's mother then telephones Joanna and tells her to tell Holden that Rand Hobart knows how to reverse the curse. Joanna then goes to her car and is about to leave when someone steps out of the bushes and prevents her...Hobart is brought by ambulance to the conference, and Holden explains to the delegates that he and O'Brien will use hypnosis to bring Rand Hobart out of his catatonic state. Hobart is injected by O'Brien with stimulants, and regains consciousness but begins screaming wildly until Holden hypnotises him. Holden shows his runic parchment to the hypnotised Hobart who then he reveals that he was going to be the original victim of the demon, rather than the man of whose murder he is accused. In order to reverse the curse he had secretly to pass the parchment containing the runic inscription back the person who gave it originally. Hobart then breaks free and then dives through a window to his death.Finally convinced of the reality of the curse, Holden decides to return the parchment to Karswell and is informed by Kumar that Mrs. Karswell had told telephoned to say her son would be on the 8.45 to train to Southampton. Holden just catches the train as it pulls out of the platform. As it does so, visible on it are two plain-clothes police-officers. He finds Karswell, who has Joanna with him, whom he has hypnotised.Holden attempts to pass Karswell an envelope containing what he claims to be a retraction. Karswell refuses to take it, fearing it is the runic one. He similarly refuses a cigarette. As the time approaches 10.00 Karswell makes to leave, but Holden insists that he stay to be present when the demon is due to arrive. The police are, however, waiting for him and come in to the carriage and restrain Holden.Karswell makes to leave, and Holden passes his coat to the policeman -- secreting the paper in its pocket. The policeman passes the coat to Karswell who takes it but then instantly realises his error, and pulls the paper out of the pocket. It flies out of his hands and goes dancing down the railway track, with Karswell in pursuit. Holden observes that it is 9.58 (\"Two of ten\").Just as Karswell reaches the paper it bursts in to flames and is destroyed. The strange noise which preceded the arrival of the Demon at the beginning of the film is heard again, the strange cloud which pursued Holden through the woods also appears above an oncoming train and the demon appears and destroys Karswell.The police and railway staff rush to see what has happened, and even though he is lying onthe wrong track that a train must have hit him and dragged him due to the mutilation of the body. Holden and Joanna refuse to look because \"it's better not to know\".The end.",

(October 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)Golden flowers fill the imperial palace on the eve of Zhong Yang. The Emperor (Chow Yun-fat) returns from his military campaign with his second son, Prince Jai (Jay Chou), in order to celebrate with his family.For three years, the Empress (Gong Li) has had an affair with her stepson, Crown Prince Wan (Liu Ye), who was born from the Emperor's first wife. Crown Prince Wan is not interested in the throne and wishes to run away with his secret lover, Jiang Chan (Li Man), the daughter of the Imperial Doctor. Meanwhile, Prince Jai (the Empress's first son), becomes worried over his mother' ill health and wonders at her sudden obsession with golden flowers. The Empress reveals that she is planning to overthrow the Emperor, who has been poisoning her. Prince Jai agrees to lead the Empress's soldiers.A mysterious woman informs the Empress that she is being poisoned with Persian Black Fungus, but immediately after making her report, Crown Prince Wan captures the woman and takes her to the Emperor. The woman identifies herself as Jiang Shi (Chen Jin), the wife of the Imperial Doctor. The Emperor is shocked when he sees her and decides not to punish her, in spite of having had her entire family killed shortly after his ascension. She reunites with her husband and daughter. The Emperor also decides to promote the Doctor to governor of the nearby province of Suzhou, so the Doctor and his family pack their things and set out.Crown Prince Wan is sad that the Doctor's daughter is leaving. He runs after their convoy and speaks to her, and learns that the Empress has woven ten thousands of scarves adorned with chrysanthemum motifs, sending them to a general of the imperial army afterwards. Fearing that this might mark the beginning of some conspiracy, Wan hurries back to the palace and confronts the Empress, who confesses that she is planning a coup d'\u00c3\u00a9tat. Out of shock and anguish, Crown Prince Wan stabs himself with a dagger and is placed under care.The Doctor's family is betrayed and attacked by the Emperor's assassins. His servants and soldiers loyally try to fight them, but the Doctor is killed. The Doctor's wife and daughter flee on horseback and head for the palace. Upon arrival, they interrupt the Chrysanthemum ceremony and demand that the Emperor answer why he wants them killed. When he remains silent, the Empress explains to everyone that the Doctor's wife is Crown Prince Wan's mother, whom the Emperor discarded in the struggle for the throne. The Doctor's daughter and Crown Prince Wan have been half-siblings all this time. The doctor's daughter screams upon hearing this and flees the palace, where she and her mother are promptly cut down by more assassins.Suddenly, the youngest son, Prince Yu, abruptly kills Crown Prince Wan with a sword, and he summons a group of his own soldiers to kill the Emperor and take the throne. He reveals that he knew about the Emperor's poisoning of the Empress, her affair with Wan and subsequent coup plans, and Wan's affair with the doctor's daughter. Declaring the rest of the family unfit, he plans to seize the throne himself. However, more of the Emperor's assassins descend from the ceiling and easily kill Prince Yu's soldiers. The Empress simply leaves the room as the Emperor proceeds to beat Prince Yu to death with his belt.Meanwhile, ten thousand soldiers wearing golden armor and golden chrysanthemum emblems storm the palace, with Prince Jai in the lead. They easily overpower the Emperor's assassins and advance into the palace's inner square, trampling the golden flowers laid out for the ceremony. However, massive silver shields block their way in, and thousands of silver-armored archers appear on the walls surrounding them. The golden soldiers initially try to fight, but the wall of silver shields is impenetrable, and they are forced to retreat. They find the gates behind them blocked, and are shot down to the last man.Prince Jai rises from the sea of dead bodies and is taken captive by the Emperor's soldiers. Behind him, the courtyard is cleaned up with mechanical efficiency by a legion of servants, with bodies being removed, floors being scrubbed and laid with carpets, and pots of yellow chrysanthemums replaced, making it seem as if the entire failed rebellion never even happened. At midnight, the Chrysanthemum Festival begins as scheduled.The Emperor speaks with Prince Jai and the Empress at the terrace's ceremonial table. He expresses disappointment at Jai's actions, revealing that he was always planning to let Wan retire and make Jai his heir. When Prince Jai confirms that he only joined the rebellion because his mother was being poisoned, the Emperor offers to forgive his son, provided he serves his mother her \"medicine\" personally every day. Prince Jai refuses, apologizes to his mother for the rebellion's failure, and kills himself with a sword. The poisoned cup is still offered to the Empress, but she shrieks and slaps it away. The film ends as the spilled medicine is shown instantly corroding the table's engraved wooden chrysanthemum, referencing a Chinese proverb \u00e9\u0087\u0091\u00e7\u008e\u0089\u00e5\u0085\u00b6\u00e5\u00a4\u0096\u00e8\u00b4\u00a5\u00e7\u00b5\u00ae\u00e5\u0085\u00b6\u00e4\u00b8\u00ad; J\u00c4\u00abn y\u00c3\u00b9 q\u00c3\u00ad w\u00c3\u00a0i, b\u00c3\u00a0i x\u00c3\u00b9 q\u00c3\u00ad zh\u00c5\u008dng, idiomatically translated as all that glistens is not gold.",

Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words.\nDeep artificial neural networks can achieve an extremely small difference between training and test accuracies on identically distributed training and test sets, which is a standard measure of generalization. However, the training and test sets may not be sufficiently representative of the empirical sample set, which consists of real-world input samples. When samples are drawn from an underrepresented or unrepresented subset during inference, the gap between the training and inference accuracies can be significant. To address this problem, we first reformulate a classification algorithm as a procedure for searching for a source code that maps input features to classes. We then derive a necessary and sufficient condition for generalization using a universal cognitive similarity metric, namely information distance, based on Kolmogorov complexity. Using this condition, we formulate an optimization problem to learn a more general classification function. To achieve this end, we extend the input features by concatenating encodings of them, and then train the classifier on the extended features. As an illustration of this idea, we focus on image classification, where we use channel codes on the input features as a systematic way to improve the degree to which the training and test sets are representative of the empirical sample set. To showcase our theoretical findings, considering that corrupted or perturbed input features belong to the empirical sample set, but typically not to the training and test sets, we demonstrate through extensive systematic experiments that, as a result of learning a more general classification function, a model trained on encoded input features is significantly more robust to common corruptions, e.g., Gaussian and shot noise, as well as adversarial perturbations, e.g., those found via projected gradient descent, than the model trained on uncoded input features.",

A simple rule of thumb to decide whether a question is a factoid or not is to see if two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage.\nAn American family\u00e2\u0080\u0094Dr. Benjamin \"Ben\" McKenna (James Stewart), his wife, popular singer Josephine Conway \"Jo\" McKenna (Doris Day), and their son Henry \"Hank\" McKenna (Christopher Olsen)\u00e2\u0080\u0094are vacationing in Morocco. Traveling from Casablanca to Marrakesh, they meet Frenchman Louis Bernard (Daniel Gelin). He seems friendly, but Jo is suspicious of his many questions and evasive answers.Louis offers to take the McKennas out to dinner, but cancels when a sinister-looking man knocks at the McKennas' hotel-room door. Later, at a local restaurant, the McKennas meet friendly English couple Lucy (Brenda De Banzie) and Edward Drayton (Bernard Miles). The McKennas are surprised to see Bernard arrive and sit at another table, apparently ignoring them.The next day, attending a busy outdoor market with the Draytons, the McKennas see a man being chased by police. After being stabbed in the back, the man approaches Ben, who discovers it is actually Louis in disguise. The dying Bernard whispers that a foreign statesman will be assassinated in London soon, and that Ben must tell the authorities there about \"Ambrose Chappell\". Lucy offers to return Hank to the hotel while the police question Ben and Jo. An officer explains that Louis was a French Intelligence agent on assignment in Morocco.Ben is told via a phone call that Hank has been kidnapped but will not be harmed if the McKennas say nothing to the police about Bernard's warning.In London, Scotland Yard's Inspector Buchanan (Ralph Truman) tells them Louis was trying to uncover an assassination plot, and that they should contact him if they hear from the kidnappers. Leaving friends in their hotel suite, the McKennas search for a man named \"Ambrose Chappell\" and find \"Ambrose Chapel\", where Drayton is leading a service. Ben confronts Drayton and is knocked out and locked in the chapel. The Draytons take Hank to a foreign embassy just before Jo arrives with police at the now-deserted chapel. Jo learns that Buchanan has gone to a concert at the Royal Albert Hall. There, she sees the sinister man who came to her door in Morocco. When he threatens to harm Hank if she interferes, she realizes that he is the assassin sent to kill the foreign Prime Minister (Alexis Bobrinskoy) at the concert.Ben escapes and follows Jo to the Hall, where she points out the assassin. Ben searches the balcony boxes for the killer, who is waiting for a cymbal crash to mask his gunshot. Jo screams and the assassin misses his mark, merely wounding his target. Ben struggles with the would-be killer, who falls to his death from the balcony.The grateful Prime Minister invites the McKennas to the embassy, where they learn that the Draytons and Hank are also there. The ambassador (Mogens Wieth) himself organized the plot to kill the Prime Minister.The Prime Minister asks Jo to sing. She loudly performs \"Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)\", so that Hank will hear her. Lucy is guarding Hank, but tells him to whistle along with the song, and Ben finds him. Drayton tries to escape with them at gunpoint, but when Ben hits him, he falls and dies accidentally.The McKennas return to their hotel room. Ben explains to their now-sleeping friends, \"I'm sorry we were gone so long, but we had to go over and pick up Hank.\"",

    "user_prompt": "You will be given a summary of a story. You need to create a question that can be answered from the story. You can create a question about characters, events, facts and beliefs, etc. Your question should be specific, try not to use pronouns instead of full names. As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning.\n A little girl named Lucie lives on a farm called Little-town. She is a good little girl, but has lost three pocket handkerchiefs and a pinafore. She questions Tabby Kitten and Sally Henny-penny about them, but they know nothing (especially since Tabby Kitten licks her paw, and Sally Henny-penny flaps back into the barn clucking, \"I go barefoot, barefoot, barefoot!\" neither of which is very helpful). Lucie mounts a stile and spies some white cloths lying in the grass high on a hill behind the farm. She scrambles up the hill along a steep path-way which ends under a big rock. She finds a little door in the hillside, and hears someone singing behind it:\nLily-white and clean, oh!\nWith little frills between, oh!\nSmooth and hot   red rusty spot\nNever here be seen, oh!\nShe knocks. A frightened voice cries out, \"Who's that?\" Lucie opens the door, and discovers a low-ceilinged kitchen. Everything is tiny, even the pots and pans. At the table stands a short, stout person wearing a tucked-up print gown, an apron, and a striped petticoat. She is ironing. Her little black nose goes sniffle, sniffle, snuffle, and her eyes go twinkle, twinkle, and beneath her little white cap are prickles! She is Mrs. Tiggy-winkle, the animals' laundress and \"an excellent clear-starcher\". She keeps busy with her work. She has found Lucy's lost things, and launders them for her. She also shows Lucie items belonging to Mrs. Tiggywinkle's animal customers. They have tea together though Lucie keeps away from Mrs. Tiggywinkle due to the prickles.\nThe laundered clothing is tied up in bundles and Lucie's handkerchiefs are neatly folded into her clean pinafore. They set off together down the path to return the fresh laundry to the little animals and birds in the neighbourhood. At the bottom of the hill, Lucie mounts the stile and turns to thank Mrs. Tiggy-winkle. \"But what a very odd thing!\" Mrs. Tiggy-winkle is \"running running running up the hill\". Her cap, shawl, and print gown are nowhere to be seen. How small and brown she has grown   and covered with prickles! \"Why! Mrs. Tiggy-winkle [is] nothing but a HEDGEHOG!\"\nThe narrator tells the reader that some thought Lucie had fallen asleep on the stile and dreamed the encounter, but if so, then how could she have three clean handkerchiefs and a laundered pinafore? \"Besides,\" the narrator assures the reader, \"I have seen that door into the back of the hill called Catbells   and besides I am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!\"",

Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes).\nContext: In law, a merism is a figure of speech by which a single thing is referred to by a conventional phrase that enumerates several of its parts, \"or\" which lists several synonyms for the same thing., Pars pro toto, Latin for \"a part (taken) for the whole\", is a figure of speech where the name of a \"portion\" of an object, place, or concept represents its \"entirety\". It is distinct from a merism, which is a reference to a whole by an enumeration of parts; metonymy, where an object, place, or concept is called by something or some place associated with the object, place, or concept; or synecdoche, which can refer both to this and its inverse of the whole representing a part., Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets., The Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the late 9th century BC or early 8th century BC It was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, and was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants. It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields., The Indo-European languages are a language family of several hundred related languages and dialects. There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by \"Ethnologue\", with over two-thirds (313) of them belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch. The most widely spoken Indo-European languages by native speakers are Spanish, English, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu), Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, Persian and Punjabi, each with over 100 million speakers. Today, 46% of the human population speaks an Indo-European language natively, by far the highest of any language family., A figure of speech or rhetorical figure is figurative language in the form of a single word or phrase. It can be a special repetition, arrangement or omission of words with literal meaning, or a phrase with a specialized meaning not based on the literal meaning of the words. Figures of speech often provide emphasis, freshness of expression, or clarity. However, clarity may also suffer from their use, as any figure of speech introduces an ambiguity between literal and figurative interpretation., A synecdoche (; from Greek , \"synekdoche\", . \"simultaneous understanding\") is a figure of speech in which a term for a part of something refers to the whole of something or vice versa. A synecdoche is a class of metonymy, often by means of either mentioning a part for the whole or conversely the whole for one of its parts. Examples from common English expressions include \"bread and butter\" (for \"livelihood\"), \"suits\" (for \"businesspeople\"), and \"boots\" (for \"soldiers\") (Pars pro toto), or conversely \"America\" (for \"the United States of America\") (Totum pro parte). , The classical Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language. The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet which was modified over time to become the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin alphabet., A classical language is a language with a literature that is \"classical\". According to UC Berkeley linguist George L. Hart, \"it should be ancient, it should be an independent tradition that arose mostly on its own, not as an offshoot of another tradition, and it must have a large and extremely rich body of ancient literature.\", Totum pro parte is Latin for `` the whole for a part '' ; it refers to a kind of synecdoche . When used in a context of language it means that something is named after something of which it is only a part ( or only a limited characteristic , in itself not necessarily representative for the whole ) . A pars pro toto ( in which a part is used to describe the whole ) is the opposite of a totum pro parte ., Metonymy is a figure of speech in which a thing or concept is called not by its own name but rather by a metonym, the name of something associated in meaning with that thing or concept. The words \"metonymy\" and \"metonym\" come from the , , \"a change of name\", from , , \"after, beyond\" and , , a suffix used to name figures of speech, from , or , , \"name\"., Subject: totum pro parte, Relation: instance_of, Options: (A) alphabet (B) bengali (C) branch (D) butter (E) change (F) class (G) enumeration (H) human (I) hundred (J) language (K) language family (L) law (M) limited (N) literature (O) metonymy (P) name (Q) object (R) part (S) phrase (T) population (U) reference (V) representative (W) script (X) speech (Y) term (Z) tradition ([) understanding (\\) writing (]) writing system",

This was also the first time Brady played the 49ers in San Francisco, as he missed the Patriots' trip to Candlestick Park in 2008 as a result of an injury. After a 49ers three-and-out, Amendola returned the punt 30 yards to the 49ers 27. Six plays later, Brady hit Edelman on a 7-yard touchdown pass, but Gostkowski missed the extra point. The 49ers drove all the way to the Patriots 6 on their next drive, but Hightower sacked Colin Kaepernick for a 9-yard loss on 3rd-down and they were forced to settle for a 33-yard field goal by Phil Dawson. The Patriots countered on their next drive, racing 77 yards in just 6 plays, scoring on Brady's 9-yard touchdown pass to James White, increasing the lead to 13-3. Two possessions later, the 49ers raced 92 yards in just over four minutes, scoring on an 18-yard touchdown catch by Vance McDonald, trimming the deficit to 13-10. After both teams punted, the Patriots drove to the 49ers 41, but White couldn't get out of bounds in time after a 25-yard catch, and the Patriots led 13-10 at halftime. After the first four possessions of the second half ended in punts, the Patriots marched 80 yards in 10 plays, scoring on Brady's 5-yard connection to Amendola, increasing the lead to 20-10. Three possessions later, Brady found Mitchell for a 56-yard touchdown pass as Brady was falling down, capping off a 70-yard drive, upping the lead to 27-10. After a 49ers three-and-out, the Patriots kept pouring it on, driving all the way to the 49ers 20, and Gostkowski added a 38-yard field goal, widening the lead to 30-10. The Niners marched 75 yards on their next drive, scoring on Kaepernick's 13-yard touchdown pass to Shaun Draughn, trimming the deficit to 30-17. Amendola recovered the ensuing onside kick and the Patriots ran out the rest of the clock to end the game. The Patriots improved to 8-2. Running back LeGarrette Blount had a big day as he rushed for a total of 125 yards on 19 carries. In addition, Tom Brady also had a big day passing for a total of 4 touchdowns against the 49ers. This was also Brady's 199th career win (regular season and postseason combined), tied with Brett Favre for second place.",

This would be the first time that Buffalo ever hosted Tampa Bay in a regular season game, having played a preseason game with each other in 1977. In the first quarter, the Bills came out firing as quarterback Trent Edwards completed a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Lee Evans, safety Donte Whitner returning an interception 76 yards for a touchdown and kicker Rian Lindell making a 31-yard field goal. The Buccaneers would get on the board in the second quarter as quarterback Byron Leftwich completed a 42-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kellen Winslow, while Buffalo replied with Lindell getting a 43-yard field goal. Tampa Bay would close out the half as Leftwich completed an 8-yard touchdown pass to running back Carnell \"Cadillac\" Williams. After a scoreless third quarter, the Bills began to pull away as Lindell got a 43-yard field goal and Edwards completed a 43-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrell Owens. The Buccaneers tried to rally as Leftwich completed a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jerramy Stevens (with a failed two-point conversion), yet Buffalo closed out the game with Lindell nailing a 20-yard field goal. With the win, the Bills improved to 1-1.",

Both you and your neighbors may start in getting known to each other by introducing yourselves. This is a sign that you and your neighbors are actually friends. Instead of watching television and playing computer games all the time, you also need to take a break and have some fun talking with your neighbors. But if you want to make friends with them, you need to do something that might please them. The only problem for this situation is that you are afraid to approach and greet them in a nice way. This is a challenge that you or your fellow neighbors must be aware of. You need to get as many friends as possible in your neighborhood, and one of them is to get closer with the unfriendly.

Note that the answer may not be present in exact form.\nHow does Hot Water Extraction compare to Dry Carpet Cleaning? Most major carpet manufacturers like Philadelphia Shaw contest that Hot Water Extraction is the most effective carpet cleaning method on the market, as well as the least harmful to you and your family's health. Wait about an hour, then vacuum. 1  Wait until HOST is completely dry (about an hour) and then simply vacuum. 2  HOST will lighten to a pale gold color as it dries. 3  Since HOST is all natural and safe for people and pets, you can use your room while it\u2019s drying. 4  After vacuuming, a trace of HOST may remain in the carpet. A carpet cleaner is designed to force a mixture of hot water and cleaning solution into the carpet to clean deep down. The solution and dirt are then extracted from the carpet, leaving the fibers and carpet base clean. Vacuums, even the best ones, simply can't reach the deep-down dirt at the base of your carpet's fibers. The carpet cleaning process is engineered to reach the dirt vacuums leave behind. Incidentally, although carpet cleaning does so much more than vacuuming, the actual work process itself is about as easy as vacuuming. How long will it take my carpet to dry after deep cleaning? Drying time will vary by the type of carpet, thickness of the pad and the cleaning techniques of the user. On average, it's best to wait four to six hours before walking on the carpet after carpet cleaning. In all modesty, we pioneered the category. BISSELL Carpet Cleaning machines are recognized as the high-quality standard of the industry with durability and reliability engineered into each unit, every step of the way. After Your Carpet Cleaning How long does it take the carpet to dry? Your carpet will be only slightly damp to the touch after your cleaning. Most carpets typically need 6-10 hours to dry completely. However, it could take up to 24 hours to dry depending on the time of year your carpets are cleaned, and the air circulation, humidity and temperature in your home. Carpet manufacturers also recommend the reapplication of stain resisting formula at least every two years, and BISSELL brand carpet cleaning formulas are the only ones that contain Scotchgard\u2122 protection.

With the help of social media, rumors -- no matter whether they are true or false -- spread like wildfire, and sometimes we can't be sure what to believe. Now, an international group of researchers might be able to make it easier for us. They are working on a lie detector that could separate online truth from lies, Discovery news reported. Named after the Greek goddess Pheme, famed for spreading bad rumors, the system is far from a traditional lie detector, which works by attaching a machine to a potential liar. Instead, Pheme analyzes the rumor directly. When a rumor comes out, on a micro blog, for example, Pheme can trace the source of information to see if it was released by reliable sources like experts or news agencies. If it wasn't, Pheme then examines the history and background of the account to identify whether it was created just to spread rumors -- whether it's what's called an \"Internet bot.\" After finding the source of the rumor, the system can keep a close eye on how other users react to the rumor -- either confirming or denying it -- to help analyze and further determine the reliability of the information. Some people might find the Pheme system unnecessary based on the idea that false rumors never survive for long and people always get to the truth over time. While that's a fair point, there is a certain class of rumors, such as \"a tiger is at large\" or \"an asteroid   is about to hit the Earth\", that can cause panic among people and thus lead to serious consequences. These are cases when we need to be able to check for accuracy quickly. \"Our system aims to help with that, by tracking and verifying information in real time,\" lead researcher Kalina Bontcheva, at the University of Sheffield, UK, told the BBC. According to Bontcheva, Pheme is still under development and won't be ready for another 18 months.[:. . ] Until then, there's an old fashioned technique that you can use to protect yourself from false information -- ask questions, check sources and don't believe any claim until you've seen the evidence for it. \n Answer: An introduction to some types of lie detectors.",

From there, he decided to attack the Dauphin-held town of Meaux. It turned out to be more difficult to overcome than first thought. The siege began about 6 October 1421, and the town held for seven months before finally falling on 11 May 1422. At the end of May, Henry was joined by his queen and together with the French court, they went to rest at Senlis. While there, it became apparent that he was ill , and when he set out to the Upper Loire, he diverted to the royal castle at Vincennes, near Paris, where he died on 31 August 1422. The elderly and insane Charles VI of France died two months later on 21 October 1422. Henry left an only child, his nine-month-old son, Henry, later to become Henry VI. On his deathbed, Henry V had given the Duke of Bedford responsibility for English France . The war in France continued under Bedford's generalship and several battles were won. The English won an emphatic victory at the Battle of Verneuil . At the Battle of Baug\u00e9, Clarence had rushed into battle without the support of his archers. At Verneuil, the archers fought to devastating effect against the Franco-Scottish army.

A man, named Fabio, is speaking to Don Luis, a drug lord and his boss. Fabio tells him he is quitting and handing over all the book keeping on the cartel to another associate. Don Luis smiles and says he will miss him and they toast to Fabio's life. Fabio leaves and Don Luis motions to Marco (Jordi Molla), his right hand man. \"Kill him!,\" Don Luis says \"No one leaves Don Luis's cartel\".But Fabio is not stupid. He knows his boss will retaliate at anyone wanting to leave the life of drug smuggling... including him. Fabio takes three guards loyal to him and races home, knowing they have only an hour to leave the country. Fabio gets home and tells his wife, Alicia, that \"it's time\". He tells his young daughter, Cataleya, to pack but she says she is already ready. Fabio tells her in case something happens, she should go the American embassy and give them a microchip. It has all the information on Don Luis's illegal activities. \"It's your passport.\" He also gives her an address for his brother. Fabio then gives his daughter his necklace that has the Cataleya flower on it. She was named after it, because his mother always grew them. \"Never forget who you are.\" he says.Minutes later, Marco and numerous cartel members show up and slaughter Fabio's men. Fabio and Alicia grab guns and try to hold the men off but are killed off-screen. Cataleya sits at the table in shock and listens to the gunfire. She quickly swallows the microchip. Marco and the men come up to Cataleya. Marco pretends to be friendly saying he was a friend of her father but Fabio took something from Don Luis; the microchip. Marco asks if she knows where it is and she nods. Marco asks what she wants. Cataleya leans in close... and grabs a knife placed under the tabled and stabs him in the hand. \"To kill Don Luis!\" screams Cataleya.Cataleya scoops through a window and onto a ledge. Apparently her parents taught her skills to survive in case something like this happened. She runs off to escape while Marco's cartel goons give chase. Despite having parkour runners, men on motorcycles and in cars, Cataleya eludes them by escaping into the sewers. She opens a manhole cover and heads to the U.S. Embassy where she is sent to an agent who asks about her father. Cataleya says he is dead. The man asks if her dad had something, and Cataleya quick forces herself to throw up and gives him the microchip. It has the records of all Don Luis's activities. The agent looks at her in shock and asks if she realizes what she had. \"My passport.\" Cataleya says.In exchange for the chip, they get her out of the country and papers. An American CIA agent is escorting her to Miami. Cataleya asks to go to the bathroom and escapes through the window. She gets a bus ticket to Chicago, where her father told her to go. She heads for a seedy neighborhood and asks for Emilio. The man Emilio (Cliff Curtis) is Fabio's brother, and her uncle. When Emilio sees her, he is overcome and hugs her. Cataleya is finally able to let go, and cries in her uncle's arms.The next morning, she wakes up in her uncle's apartment and comes down to breakfast. Her grandmother is there who makes her breakfast. Cataleya asks about whose room she slept in. Emilio looks sad and says it was his son's room and he is dead. Emilio asks her about a drawing she did and she says she used to want to be like Xena but not any more. Emilio asks what she wants now. \"To be a killer. Will you help me?\" says Cataleya. Emilio replies \"sure\".The next day, Emilio takes her to a private prep school and bribes the principal to accept her in the middle of the school year. As they leave, Cataleya is mad because she thinks she can learn nothing at school. She needs to learn how to be an assassin. Emilio suddenly pulls out a revolver and shoots at a person driving a car, causing it to crash. He tells her that hired killers are a dime a dozen, he could teach her and she'd be dead in five years. If she wants to do this and be smart, she needs to go to school. She needs to know how people think. Cataleya listens to him.PRESENT DAYTwo cops are sitting in their car, talking about their wives when they are smashed into by a drunk driver. A woman comes out, incoherently babbling. They quickly arrest her and we can see a flower necklace on the woman. It is Cataleya (Zoe Saldana) all grown up. They take her to the police station.There, she is booked on DUI and thrown into a cell for the night. She goes to sleep.U.S. Marshals show up that night with a prisoner. They take him to his cell. Cataleya wakes up. Her whole DUI was a ruse to get into the police station. The prisoner is the target. She changes her clothes into a skin tight black suit, and picks the lock. She grabs a spoon that was in a cup of coffee at her cell. She swivels the cameras away so she is not seen, and grabs some water from the cooler and heads to the electrical room. She rigs the cup and the spoon to cause a spark out and heads into the air ducts. After a few seconds, the water from the cup leaks out enough to short out the power. Cataleya gets through a now stopped fan just before the power is reset. She drops into the men's restroom.The cop guarding the prisoner notices he has no coffee and leaves the room. He goes into the bathroom and is knocked out by Cataleya. She drags his body in front of the camera so the door will be reopened. She opens the cell and hits the prisoner awake. She tells him to undo his shirt. He asks 'why' and she shoots him several times.The Marshals hear the gunshots and run to the cell to see the waking up guard with the gun in his hand. Cataleya framed him for the killing to buy her time to escape. The Marshals still search the entire building and Cataleya goes up to the roof to elude them. When the coast is clear, she heads back through the air ducts, finds her cell, locks the door, and changes back into her clothes. By the time the marshals find her, she is laying back down pretending to sleep again. The marshals have no clue what happened.Cataleya is released the next day after being fingerprinted. She leaves the jail and pulls at her hand. She was wearing fake latex skin that replicated another person's prints.Cataleya goes home and dances to some music. She gets a shower and washes herself for a long time.Cataleya heads to the apartment of Danny (Michael Vartan), a painter and her quasi boyfriend. Danny knows little about her, and only knows her as \"Jennifer.\" Danny and Cataleya have sex and she leaves the next morning without saying goodbye. It is clear she is afraid to show who she really is to him.FBI Special Agent Ross (Lennie James) comes to the jail and realizes the victim is the latest of a string of murders they have been tracking for the past four years, 22 in all. They call the perp \"The Tag Killer\" due to the markings the killer leaves on the chest. We see it is the Cataleya flower.CIA Agent Richard (Callum Blue) travels to New Orleans to a heavily guarded villa. It is the home of Don Luis, who was not persecuted for his crimes. Richard shows him the hit from the jail cells, but Luis denies he had anything to do with it. Richard tells him that the CIA was very nice with him; he got Witness protection and got to continue to run his cocaine smuggling business in exchange for information. But Richard tells him he knows that something is up and Luis knows what it is. After Richard leaves, Luis tells Marco to handle the situation. Luis strongly suspects that Cataleya is behind the killings. As he didn't kill Cataleya the first time, now he must finish it.Ross holds a meeting about the Tag Killer and their numerous victims. He concludes that one of the people in the jail killed the target and they need to find out who. Ross also says they need to release the information about the case.Meanwhile, Cataleya goes to see Emilio. He shows her the paper with her calling card. He is livid, calling the action stupid. Emilio says he promised his brother to protect her. He never wanted her to go down this road. He is always funneling jobs away in order to protect her. Cataleya, defiant, says she CHOSE this path herself and she will not stop until Luis is dead. Emilio sighs and hands her the next job. A hedge manager created a ponzi scheme and stole billions and fled the country. People want him dead.Ross is at the FBI office going over security footage. Some of his agents think the killer is Cataleya seen on the tape but he cannot believe a woman would be this type of killer.Cataleya goes to her work office where there are two large dogs who happen to listen to her. She feeds them steaks. Inside, Pepe, a friend of Emilio is there. He handles her weapons and cars. Cataleya goes into a safe and pulls out her fake passports and finds one for Mexico.Mexico. We find ourselves in the mansion of the hedge manager who lives in opulence surrounded by stunning women he wouldn't have a chance in hell with if he didn't have billions. One woman mentions the sharks in the aquarium pool are ignoring her, but the man tells her one drop of blood and they would become her best friend as they ate her. The hedge fund manager tells his security he wants extra men tonight.Cataleya swims through the aquarium, the sharks ignoring her and pushes up a glass cover to enter the mansion. She pulls out a pistol and silencer.The hedge fund manager gets up and notices Cataleya wrote on him \"Thief\" and the flower design. He walks around his mansion and notices all his guards are dead. He picks up two guns and heads into the pool area seeing a flower. Cataleya is sitting in a chair and makes her presence known. He tries to shoot her but his guns are empty. Cataleya shoots him in the legs. The man pleads with her to not kill him, he will pay double what she was paid. \"I'm not going to kill you.\" Cataleya says. The man realizes he is underneath the sharks and understands what she meant. He pleads not to let him die, but Cataleya shoots him in the chest and he falls into the opened pool. The blood flows and his sharks eat him alive in seconds.Back in the USA, Cataleya goes to Danny's apartment but he left to see about some galleries. She sleeps on his bed and holds his shirt close. It is clear she cares about him, but she is afraid to show it.Meanwhile, Ross is looking at the Tag Killer calling card when the mailman gives him a vital clue; it is the Cataleya flower that only grows in Colombia. Ross tries to tie it to open cases in Colombia but is denied access due to it falling under CIA jurisdiction.Ross calls Richard and asks for clearance but Richard dodges the issue. He calls Luis and tells him to handle the problem before Agent Ross starts to connect the dots. Luis sends Marco to track Cataleya down and interrogate every Colombian until it leads to her family.Danny comes home and Cataleya bought dinner. He is happy and Cataleya kisses him. Danny stops her and asks to sit, eat dinner, and talk some. She asks about his trip and he tells her they want to do a gallery of his work. Danny asks about her trip and she said it was hot and she swimmed some. Danny presses for more but she is reluctant. Danny tells her he just wants to know who she is. Danny asks what she likes for breakfast. \"I don't eat breakfast.\" Cataleya says. Danny and Cataleya sleep together again.It is now mid day. Danny takes a quick photo of Cataleya sleeping. He wakes her up with breakfast food and tells her they can eat it for lunch. Cataleya freaks out and says she did too much and she has to leave. Danny is flustered, wondering what the hell he did wrong.Cataleya meets with Emilio. He is livid, having seen the paper. Cataleya has not stopped with her calling card. People are looking for them, showing that eight people were gunned down in a bar, one being a friend of Emilio. \"You're retired.\" Emilio tells her. Cataleya refuses to quit but Emilio says it is not just about her, it is about the family she has left, she is putting them in danger. When his son died, he killed many people, but it changed nothing and he put his family at risk. Emilio leaves her with a picture of her parents, a reminder of what can be lost. Cataleya sits and cries.Cataleya goes to church with Emilio and her grandmother. She seems to be ready to give up her quest for revenge.Danny is at a coffee shop talking about his girlfriend \"Jennifer\" to a buddy saying he is falling for her but he knows nothing about her. The buddy sees the photo and is shocked on how hot she is. Danny is distracted with his car being ticketed so his friend takes the phone with the photo and calls his sister in law who works at a police station. He asks her to check on \"Jennifer\" to make sure she is legit so Danny won't be hurt. The man has no clue what he has done.Ross is at his computer when it is pinged with Cataleya's photo. He traces the signal to the other police station, and has the technician arrested as they track the signal further. Ross compares the photo to the security footage at the jail and its a match. Cataleya is the woman who he is looking for.Cataleya goes home and calls Danny, trying to articulate how she feels about him. Danny mentions the photo and she freaks, asking who else saw it. He mentions his friend as Cataleya checks the perimeter of her apartment. SWAT is there to arrest her. She turns on the shower and climbs into a duct to escape out of her apartment.She runs through several apartments, and enters one. The tenant tries to make a fuss so she knocks him out. She recovers a harness and a sniper rifle in the man's bathroom, she previously planted it there. She plants explosives on the wall as Ross and his agents blow the door to her apartment. She uses the harness to slide down the pipes down to the garage. She shoots out the cameras and is able to slide into another air duct before SWAT finds her. She ends up in the subway and she sneaks away.Cataleya heads to Emilio's but finds the place ransacked. Pepe is on the floor dead. She finds her grandmother dead in the kitchen, making her break down. She looks for Emilio and finds him tied a chair dead. It was clear he was tortured. Cataleya tells him she's sorry and screams in a combination of sadness and anger.Ross comes home and Cataleya is there waiting with a gun. She motions for him to sit. She reveals that she has rigged his chair with a pressure senstive explosive so he shouldn't try anything funny. Cataleya tells him she's who he has been looking for. The Cataleya flower tag was a sign to call out Don Luis but it took till now to get his attention. Now he took the last part of her. Cataleya tells Ross he better get the information about Don Luis from the CIA or she will kill a family member once a week until he is as hollow as she felt all those years ago. She promises his bomb will be deactivated as soon as she is as gone which it is.Ross goes to Richard and tells him the situation. Richard will not give up the info. Ross gets a call. It's Cataleya who tells him either Richard gives her the address or he will die. Richard scoffs since his windows are reinforced glass. Cataleya shoots off a round with her sniper rifle, breaking through the glass. Richard gives him the address. Ross asks about his family but Cataleya hangs up (but she had no intention of harming them anyway).Cataleya goes to Pepe's garage. She grabs some guns. She sees the two dogs and looks at them. She grabs the armor truck and drives off to Don Luis's location.At Don Luis's mansion, Marco is directing the men what they face with Cataleya. She is not to be taken lightly. Luis hears something. It is a rocket that is coming their way. Luis barely gets out of the way as it blows up the room. Marco pulls him up and they try to get him out of there.Four of the men get into a car in order to start a convoy. Cataleya busts through with her truck, crushing the car. She gets out and peppers the car with bullets, killing the men.In the climatic shootout, bit by bit, she kills off Luis and Marco's men. Marco place Luis in a safe room while he tries to kill Cataleya. After a few brief shootouts it is just Marco with one other man. Cataleya kills the man then faces Marco with her gun. They begin to fight hand to hand, alternately disarming each other with Cataleya's handgun. Cataleya turns to using a towel to try and choke him. After awhile, Marco grabs the gun and goes to fire, but Cataleya ejects the clip and rips the slide off the gun and stabs him the neck, killing him.Luis, realizing all his men are dead, but Cataleya doesn't know where he is, leaves the panic room and takes one of his vans. He runs into a dead end due to a garbage truck. He receives a call from Marco's cell. It is Cataleya. Luis tells her that she will never kill him, she never had him. \"Actually, I have you EXACTLY where I want you.\" Cataleya says. Luis looks back and sees Cataleya two dogs. \"Eat!\" Cataleya tells the dogs. They tear Don Luis apart, making her revenge complete.Danny was taken into custody by Ross and the FBI. Danny knows little and tells them so. Ross says while he is not under arrest he still has questions to answer. Danny asks for coffee and Ross goes to get it. Danny gets a call from Cataleya. She tells him she's OK and they have 40 seconds before they trace the call, so that's enough time to ask three questions. He asks for her real name and she tells him it's Cataleya. Danny asks if his little bird will return one day (meaning her). Cataleya tells him that maybe one day she can.An agent tells Ross that Danny is getting a call from Cataleya, and they rush back in.Danny has only seconds now. \"I love you.\" Danny says which makes Cataleya tear up. Ross orders him to give over the phone but Cataleya hangs up before he can get anything from her. Ross stares at the phone and tells Danny he's free to go.Cataleya puts her sunglasses on and gets on a bus for a destination unknown.",

German authorities do not expect a shortage of the drug, FDA said. The FDA began probing Baxter\u2019s heparin several weeks ago after it was linked with to four deaths and hundreds of severe reactions, such as breathing problems and rapid drops in blood pressure. On Wednesday it said it identified a contaminant that may be linked with the drug\u2019s problems. Some 19 fatalities have now been associated with use of the drug in the United States, the FDA said on Wednesday. However, all the deaths have not been linked to a specific drug maker. The other major U.S. heparin supplier, APP Pharmaceuticals Inc, has ramped up production to avoid a drug shortage. Tests on APP\u2019s heparin have not found any contamination, Woodcock said on Wednesday. No fatalities were seen in Germany, and \u201cless than 100\u201d severe reactions led to the recall, the FDA said. The German product manufacturer, Rotexmedica GmbH, could not be immediately reached for comment. Heparin is derived from pig intestines. It is used in dialysis and heart procedures, among other surgeries, to avoid blood clots. FDA officials also advised companies and countries to begin using a sophisticated testing technique the agency used to find the potential contaminant, to test all heparin on the market. \u201cWith this testing method, there will be a way to protect the heparin supply,\u201d Woodcock said. Baxter\u2019s main supplier is Wisconsin-based Scientific Protein Laboratories LLC (SPL), which has a major facility in China, a main subject of FDA\u2019s investigation. About 80 percent of the active pharmaceutical ingredients come from foreign sources, according to U.S. government investigators. Most of the world\u2019s heparin supply is from China, according to Baxter. The FDA inspects only about 7 percent of foreign manufacturing facilities annually, according to the Government Accountability Office, a congressional watchdog agency. China\u2019s reputation has been tainted after health scares with pigs and massive recalls of pet food and children\u2019s toys containing lead paint. Sidney Wolfe, head of health research at the consumer group Public Citizen, said the FDA has poorly allocated its resources for inspections. \u201cChina has a tiny fraction of plants being inspected as opposed to India, which is dangerous considering that China is a country far less advanced,\u201d Wolfe said. The FDA conducted about 13 inspections at Chinese plants in 2007, versus 65 at plants in India. China has 714 facilities against India\u2019s 410, according to the GAO report. Baxter has recalled most of its U.S. supplies of the drug. It sells the product in other European countries but not in Germany. But Baxter does not sell the specific vial-based product linked to the four U.S. deaths in European markets, company spokeswoman Erin Gardiner said.",

Under his leadership, the economy begins to thrive and he assembles a force of government-employed superheroes consisting of Captain Atom, Starfire, Katana, Black Lightning, Power Girl, and Major Force. Meanwhile, Superman and Batman maintain their distrust toward Luthor.The United States government discovers that a massive Kryptonite meteor is hurtling toward Earth. Instead of asking superheroes for aid and wanting to take credit for himself, Lex decides to destroy it with nuclear missiles. Lex arranges a meeting with Superman in Gotham City under the pretense of forming a pact. This results in a battle between the hired Metallo and Superman and Batman. Following the heroes' escape, Metallo is killed by an unknown assailant. Later that night, Lex pins Metallo's murder on Superman, using footage of their battle to implicate him. Lex claims that the radiation being emitted by the meteor affects Superman's judgment, and he places a one-billion-dollar bounty on the Man of Steel's head.While breaking into S.T.A.R. Labs, seeking information on the meteor, Batman and Superman find Metallo's remains and realize that intense radiation has killed him. They are then attacked by an army of villains looking to collect on the bounty. The army includes: Silver Banshee, Captain Cold, Icicle, Killer Frost, Mr. Freeze, Gorilla Grodd, Bane, Black Manta, Black Spider, Brimstone, Catman, Cheetah, Copperhead, Deadshot, Kestrel, King Shark, Brutale, Despero, Giganta, Girder, Lady Shiva, Mongul, Captain Boomerang II, Nightshade, Parasite, Solomon Grundy, and Shrike. After some effort, most of the villains are defeated.The remaining villains are defeated by Captain Atom, who has arrived with Lex's superhero team to arrest Superman. All but Power Girl, whose loyalties are divided, attempt to capture the heroic duo. Superman creates a hurricane using his superspeed, and the two heroes escape with Power Girl.In Metropolis, Power Girl admits that she feels threatened by Lex, and doesn't believe Superman killed Metallo. Lex's superheroes catch up and the fight begins again, this time with Power Girl aiding Superman and Batman. The Dark Knight realizes that Major Force killed Metallo under Luthor's orders and goads him into admitting it in front of everyone. In anger, Power Girl punches him in the stomach with so much force that it ruptures his containment suit. Captain Atom, ashamed at his complicity in Lex's misdeeds, absorbs the energy, disintegrating Major Force and injuring himself in the process.Meanwhile, Lex's missiles fail to stop the meteor due to the sheer amount of radiation being emitted. Amanda Waller discovers that Lex has secretly been taking kryptonite steroids, making him lose whatever rationality he had left. Lex decides to let the meteor hit the Earth so that he may rule what remains behind. Batman and Superman break into Lex's lab to retrieve data on the meteor's radiation. They end up in battle with Captain Marvel and Hawkman, eventually emerging victorious with Power Girl's aid. Though Lex is unwilling to relinquish the data, going so far as to erase it from the lab computers, Waller gives them a copy. Batman and Superman fly off to Tokyo to submit the meteor's data to the Japanese Toyman. Waller tries to have Lex arrested, but he injects himself with more kryptonite steroids and dons a power suit. After escaping Waller and the military, Lex follows Superman and Batman.Toyman has built a rocket-propelled spacecraft, intending to use it as a powerful missile to stop the meteor. The ship resembles a giant, robotic composite version of Superman and Batman. With the data, Toyman is able to calculate the necessary reinforcements needed for his own rocket so it won't explode before impact, as Luthor's missiles did. Lex arrives and disables the remote guidance systems. Batman volunteers to fly the ship himself, despite Superman's protests. Though initially faring poorly against Lex and his kryptonite power suit, Superman finally defeats Luthor in the streets of Metropolis in an aerial battle. Batman succeeds in destroying the meteor, and Superman finds him alive and well in an escape pod.With the truth of Metallo's death public knowledge, Superman is cleared of the murder charge and Luthor is arrested, all the while ranting that he, as President, cannot go to prison. Batman then returns to Gotham while the Daily Planet's star journalist, Lois Lane, arrives and she and the Man of Steel happily embrace.",

Your task is to summarize them.\nWhitney Houston was back on top last week thanks to her comeback album, I Look To You. But for the past decade-plus, the singer told Oprah Winfrey on Monday, her life has been a roller coaster of drugs, jealousy, emotional abuse and a chaotic, \"crazy love\" with ex-husband Bobby Brown . \n  \n \"He was my drug,\" Houston, 46, said on the season premiere of \"The Oprah Winfrey Show.\" \"I didn't do anything without him. I wasn't getting high by myself. It was me and him together, and we were partners, and that's what my high was \u2014 him. He and I being together, and whatever we did, we did it together. No matter what, we did it together.\" \n  \n That included descending into a frightening abyss of drugs, constant fighting and bizarre behavior that included Brown spray-painting \"evil eyes\" on the walls, carpets and closet doors of their home. \n  \n \"Evil eyes that were looking at every point in the room,\" Houston said, adding that at one point Brown also cut the heads off pictures of her. \"I'm looking at it and going, 'Lord, what's really going on here?' Because I was getting scared, because I felt something was going to blow, something was going to give.\" \n  \n The first part of the two-part interview didn't descend into the typical teary Oprah confessional, but Houston, who has sold more than 140 million albums worldwide, was unabashed in detailing the depths of misery into which she fell after achieving the pinnacle of worldwide fame in the early 1990s. \n  \n In fact, she said, that fame was part of what destroyed her marriage to Brown. When her career took off with her big-screen success in the 1992 movie \"The Bodyguard\" and its unstoppable hit single, \"I Will Always Love You,\" Houston said she tried to downplay her fame in deference to Brown, 40, whom she married in 1992 after three years of dating. The couple divorced in 2007. \n  \n \"Something happens to a man when a woman has that much fame,\" Houston said. \"I tried to play down all the time. I used to say, 'I'm Mrs. Brown, don't call me Houston.' \" \n  \n Between the deference to Brown and the drug use, Houston admitted that she eventually stopped caring about her music career. \"I had totally forgotten about that life,\" she said. \"I had so much money by that point. I wasn't thinking about any of that.\" \n  \n Aside from the drug use \u2014 Houston said her drugs of choice were marijuana and crack cocaine, while Brown allegedly preferred alcohol and marijuana laced with cocaine \u2014 the singer said their marital problems also got physical. \n  \n \"He slapped me once, but he got hit on the head three times by me,\" Houston told Winfrey, saying that she had hit Brown so hard that he fell down bleeding as their daughter, Bobbi Kristina, now 16, walked into the room. During another argument at their Atlanta home during a party she threw for her husband, she said Brown spat in her face in front of Bobbi, which left her \"very hurt, very angry.\" \n  \n Houston said the drug use got so bad at one point that her mother, Cissy Houston, showed up at the couple's Atlanta home with a court injunction and asked police to help force Whitney into rehab. \n  \n \"She said, 'I'm not losing you to the world. I'm not losing you to Satan.

A puncture mark from a needle was visible on one of her arms, and extensive cosmetic surgery, including breast implants, marred her stomach, chest and thighs, the paper reports. \n  \n The silenced songbird wore false teeth and a wig, and her eyebrows, once beautiful, were sparse. \n  \n Triggered by cocaine use, Houston\u2019s accidental drowning in the tub\u2019s overheated water caused a grisly condition called \u201cskin slippage\u201d in which chunks of her skin were literally burned off her legs and back, the Los Angeles county coroner found. \n  \n In addition to the coke that helped put her in her grave, a toxicology report revealed a drug cocktail poisoning her system with traces of marijuana, the prescription anti-anxiety drug Xanax, the muscle relaxant Flexeril and the over-the-counter antihistamine Benadryl. \n  \n The harrowing roll call of bodily assault recalls Jackson\u2019s 2009 death from a fatal dose of prescription painkillers. \n  \n The King of Pop was a mass of surgery scars from at least 13 cosmetic operations. \n  \n His hips and thighs were riddled with a dozen needle wounds from endless injections, a red discoloration marked his chest and his face was tattooed with black eyeliner and mysterious pink pigments. \n  \n While Jackson, who was 5-foot-9, weighed a mere 135 pounds at his death, Houston, who stood 5-foot-6, weighed 151 pounds. \n  \n \u201cThe body is well built, muscular and fairly well nourished,\u201d the coroner found. \n  \n dfeiden@nydailynews.com |||||",

Britain also dispatched 9,000 troops to reinforce Ferdinand's Hanoverian army, the first British troop commitment on the continent and a reversal in the policy of Pitt. Ferdinand had succeeded in driving the French from Hanover and Westphalia and re-captured the port of Emden in March 1758 before crossing the Rhine with his own forces,  which caused alarm in France. Despite Ferdinand's victory over the French at the Battle of Krefeld and the brief occupation of D\u00fcsseldorf, he was compelled by the successful manoeuvering of larger French forces to withdraw across the Rhine. By this point Frederick was increasingly concerned by the Russian advance from the east and marched to counter it. Just east of the Oder in Brandenburg-Neumark, at the Battle of Zorndorf , a Prussian army of 35,000 men under Frederick on 25 August 1758, fought a Russian army of 43,000 commanded by Count William Fermor. Both sides suffered heavy casualties - the Prussians 12,800, the Russians 18,000 - but the Russians withdrew, and Frederick claimed victory. The American historian Daniel Marston described Zorndorf as a \"draw\" as both sides were too exhausted and had taken such losses that neither wished to fight another battle with the other. In the undecided Battle of Tornow on 25 September, a Swedish army repulsed six assaults by a Prussian army but did not push on Berlin following the Battle of Fehrbellin.",

A meteorite lands near Central Park, and an extraterrestrial symbiote emerges and follows Peter to his apartment. Meanwhile, police pursue escaped prisoner and robber Flint Marko, who visits his wife and sick daughter. The chase resumes, and Marko falls into an experimental particle accelerator that fuses his body on a microscopic level with the surrounding sand, transforming him into Sandman. Harry Osborn, seeking vengeance for his father's death in the first film, attacks Peter with new weapons based on his father's Green Goblin technology. The fight results in Harry receiving amnesia, erasing his memory of Peter as Spider-Man as well as his vengeance.During a festival honoring Spider-Man, Peter kisses Gwen Stacy for show, infuriating Mary Jane. A newly superpowered Marko robs an armored car nearby and Spider-Man confronts him. Initially warning him to leave to avoid a fight, Marko easily subdues him and escapes. Later, NYPD Captain George Stacy tells Peter and Aunt May that Marko was Uncle Ben's killer, and the deceased Dennis Carradine was only Marko's accomplice. While a vengeance-obsessed Peter sleeps in his Spider-Man costume, the symbiote takes over his suit. Peter wakes up hanging from a skyscraper, discovers his costume has changed and his powers have been enhanced, but the symbiote brings out Peter's dark side over time. Wearing the new black suit, Spider-Man locates Marko and battles him in a subway tunnel, the symbiote influencing him to fight more brutally. He discovers water is Marko's weakness and breaks a water pipe to reduce Marko to mud, washing him away and believing him to be dead.Peter's changed personality alienates Mary Jane, whose career is floundering, and she finds solace with Harry. Harry recovers from his amnesia, and, urged by a hallucination of his dead father, threatens Mary Jane into break up with Peter. After Mary Jane tells Peter she loves somebody else, Harry meets with Peter and claims to be \"the other guy.\" Later, Peter, wearing the black suit, confronts Harry, and spitefully tells him his father never loved him, done with attempting to prove his innocence. After a violent fight, Harry throws a pumpkin bomb at Peter, who deflects it back, disfiguring Harry's face.Under the symbiote's influence, Peter exposes photography rival Eddie Brock by proving his fake photos depicting Spider-Man as a criminal. Soon afterwards, to make Mary Jane jealous, Peter brings Stacy's daughter, Gwen to the nightclub where Mary Jane now works, but Gwen catches on and leaves. Peter brawls with the bouncers and, after accidentally attacking Mary Jane, he realizes the symbiote is corrupting him. Retreating to a church bell tower, he discovers that he cannot remove the suit, but that the symbiote weakens when the bell rings. Peter removes the symbiote and it falls to the lower tower, landing on Brock, who had been praying for Peter's death. The symbiote bonds to Brock's body, transforming him into Venom. Brock then finds Marko, and convinces him to join forces together to defeat Peter.Brock hijacks Mary Jane's taxi and hangs it as bait from a web hundreds of feet above a sand-filled construction site while Marko keeps the police at bay. Peter seeks Harry's help, but is rejected. While Peter battles Brock and Marko, Harry learns the truth about his father's death from his butler, and goes to help Peter as he is being overpowered, resulting in a battle between the four. Harry subdues the Sandman before assisting Peter against Brock. In the ensuing confrontation, Brock attempts to impale Spider-Man on Harry's glider but Harry intervenes, taking the blow and is mortally wounded. Recalling the symbiote's weakness, Peter uses metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening Venom and allowing Peter separate Brock and the symbiote. Peter activates a pumpkin bomb from Harry's glider to destroy the symbiote but Brock dives in and the bomb kills them both.Marko explains to Peter that he committed robberies to save his dying daughter and takes Peter back to the night his uncle Ben died. While Ben was convincing Marko to go home after getting him out of his car, Carrdine hit Marko's elbow, shooting uncle Ben in an accidental knee-jerk reaction, plaguing Marko with guilt since. Peter forgives Marko, who dissipates and floats away peacefully. Peter rejoins Mary Jane and a dying Harry. The two reconcile as Harry dies beside his two best friends. After Harry's funeral, Peter and Mary Jane reconcile their relationship at the nightclub where the two have a romantic dance.",

He and his wife have very little money. When his wife needs some dental work, Manny attempts to borrow on her policy at the insurance office. Unfortunately, he closely physically resembles an armed robber who held up the office twice before, so the police are called. Manny is arrested and charged with the crime. Manny is identified by several witnesses, and he nervously misspells a word in the same way as the word appeared on the robbery note. His defense attorney, Frank O'Connor, says it's a case of mistaken identity. Manny had a swollen jaw during the time of the first hold-up, which the teller never reported but which she would have seen had Manny been the robber. He had played cards throughout the day of the second hold-up, but his alibi defense takes a serious hit when it turns out that both his card partners that he could trace had died in the meantime. The stress of all this has a devastating effect on his wife, who slowly seeps down into depression, to the point where she is institutionalized.The trial begins but midway through, a juror makes a remark which prompts the judge to grant a mistrial. While awaiting re-trial, the real robber is arrested while trying to hold-up a grocery store. Manny is exonerated.

PK's mother succumbs to a nervous breakdown, and he is sent away to a conservative Afrikaans boarding school while she recovers.\nBeing the only English speaker, PK soon earns almost universal contempt from his scathing Afrikaner fellows particularly an older student, Jaapie Botha. Botha's abuse and the inferiority complex which results strikes PK with a severe case of nocturnal enuresis, a habit which he eventually overcomes with local sangoma Dabula Manzi. In conquering his nightmares, PK is given a chicken (Mother Courage), which becomes his closest companion. Botha subsequently captures PK and Mother Courage and has them tried before a mock court while elaborating on the depth of his hatred for the British a people he holds responsible for atrocities committed during the Second Boer War. The Afrikaans boys hang Mother Courage and kill her with a rock, but their attempts to kill PK in a similar manner are interrupted by a teacher who later oversees Botha's expulsion.\nWith his mother dead, PK finds himself living with his grandfather in Barberton.

Doc warms to PK and under his guidance the latter soon becomes an excellent pianist. He is interned as an enemy alien at the onset of World War II, but PK continues to visit him regularly in prison. Doc introduces the boy to Geel Piet, a Cape Coloured inmate who takes von Vollensteen's place as PK's mentor, training him to be an excellent boxer. Piet also impresses on PK his mantra: \"first with the head, then with the heart\", a phrase that will see the young man through even greater hard times ahead.\nA maturing PK (Simon Fenton) begins to express sympathy towards black prisoners, who are detained under appalling conditions. He works with Doc to distribute contraband among the Africans, writing their letters to home, and sharing their many sufferings. The war does not end happily for PK, as Doc is repatriated and Piet seriously injured by a white warder fails to survive his sentence. PK is sent away again, this time to study at the prestigious Prince of Wales School in Johannesburg. While attending a boxing championship, he is enamoured by Maria Marais, daughter of a leading National Party official. Since her strict father will not permit them to see each other openly, they begin dating in secret. On one such outing they are introduced to Gideon Duma, a prominent boxer in Alexandra, a notorious black township. Duma's passion for resisting apartheid inspires PK, and he begins teaching English at a rural African school.\nMaria's father, incensed by the couple's ongoing relationship and PK's ties to a multiracial gym, leads him to request a formal investigation by one of his South African Police contacts, Colonel Breyten. Breyten and his sergeant, an embittered Jaapie Botha, place PK under surveillance for subversion. His clashes with the SAP finally come to a head when Maria is killed during a raid on a biracial church by the security forces. Maddened by grief, PK considers fleeing to England, but is consoled by his former boxing partner, who reminds him of all the good he can still do in Africa.\nBotha leads a violent raid on Alexandra the following night. He threatens to shoot Elias Mlungisi, the local boxing promoter, only to be confronted by PK. They spar; PK easily bests his childhood enemy. Botha is still bent on executing the erstwhile victor, but an arriving Gideon Duma despatches the policeman with a cricket bat before he can fire. Now fugitives from the apartheid government, PK and Duma vow to continue a campaign against racial injustice. Peter's closing narration identifies meaningful voices during his life; from mother and nanny, to Doc and Dabula Manzi, Geel Piet and, finally, Maria Marais.",

Inventories from the Imhoff collection from 1573\u201374, 1580 and 1588 list both panels. The next surviving Imhoff inventory, of 1628, again lists the mother's portrait, but it disappears after mention in the 1633\u201358 account books of Hans Hieronymus Imhoff, after which its whereabouts became unknown. D\u00fcrer expert Matthias Mende described the missing portrait of Barbara Holper as \"among the most severe losses in the D\u00fcrer oeuvre\".\nIn 1977, art historian Lotte Brand Philip proposed that Unknown Woman in a Coif, held by the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, was the original portrait of Barbara Holper. The Nuremberg panel was previously thought to have originated from a member of Wolgemut's workshop, a Franconian artist in his circle, or the anonymous Mainz painter Master W. B. Brand Philip's attribution was based on striking similarities in composition and its shared tone, theme and size with the father panel at the Uffizi. In both works the sitters are holding rosary beads, and D\u00fcrer attentively describes their hands. Both portraits show the sitter in the same pose, against a similarly coloured background. Both are lit from the upper left. The boards are identically cut in width and depth, although 3 cm was removed from the left edge of Barbara's panel. Brand Philip noted the similarities between the panel and D\u00fcrer's 1514 charcoal drawing Portrait of the Artist's Mother at the Age of 63. Fedja Anzelewsky agreed with the attribution, noting that both portraits bear, on their reverse, the catalogue number recorded in the Imhoff inventories, as well as \"precisely the same design of masses of dark clouds\".Anzelewsky speculated that the father's portrait, which was not listed in the 1628 Imhoff inventory, had been broken off and sold to Rudolph II of Austria. Hans Hieronymus Imhoff's lukewarm description of Barbara's portrait\u2014\"the mother of Albrecht D\u00fcrer in oil colors on wood, [but] there are many who do not believe it to be a work of D\u00fcrer\"\u2014led Brand Philip to conclude that Albrecht's panel was likely sold individually as the more accomplished and marketable of the two. The attribution is widely accepted today. In 2013 Stephan Kemperdick noted the sophistication of the Nuremberg portrait and that its three-dimensional modeling of the head displays a level of skill beyond Wolgemut and his circle.The two panels were reunited in 2012 during a D\u00fcrer exhibition in Nuremberg having been separated since sometime between 1588 and 1628.",

He wants no part in the rebellion, but while attending to some of the rebels wounded at the Battle of Sedgemoor, Peter is arrested. During the Bloody Assizes, he is convicted by the infamous Judge Jeffreys of treason on the grounds that \"if any person be in actual rebellion against the King, and another person who really and actually was not in rebellion does knowingly receive, harbour, comfort, or succour him, such a person is as much a traitor as he who indeed bore arms.\"\nThe sentence for treason is death by hanging, but King James II, for purely financial reasons, has the sentence for Blood and other convicted rebels commuted to transportation to the Caribbean, where they are to be sold into slavery. Upon arrival on the island of Barbados, Blood is bought by Colonel Bishop, initially for work in the Colonel's sugar plantations but later hired out by Bishop when Blood's skills as a physician prove superior to those of the local doctors. During his period of slavery, Blood becomes acquainted with and even friendly with Arabella Bishop, Colonel Bishop's niece, who becomes sympathetic after learning his history.\nWhen a Spanish force attacks and raids the town of Bridgetown, Blood escapes with a number of other convict-slaves (including former shipmaster Jeremy Pitt, the one-eyed giant Edward Wolverstone, former gentleman Nathaniel Hagthorpe, former Royal Navy petty officer Nicholas Dyke and former Royal Navy master gunner Ned Ogle), captures the Spaniards' ship and sails away to become one of the most successful pirates in the Caribbean, hated and feared by the Spanish and always sparing English ships. Colonel Bishop, humiliated by Blood's escape and by Blood himself, devotes himself to capturing Blood with the hope of hanging him.\nAfter the Glorious Revolution, Blood is pardoned. As a reward for saving the colony of Jamaica from a French assault, he is appointed its governor in place of Colonel Bishop, who had abandoned his post to hunt for Blood, and the novel ends with the implication that Blood will not only marry Colonel Bishop's niece Arabella but will also let Bishop off easy.",

Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning.\n The play is set in Troezen, a coastal town in the northeastern Peloponnese. Theseus, the king of Athens, is serving a year's voluntary exile after having murdered a local king and his sons. His illegitimate son is Hippolytus, whose birth is the result of Theseus's rape of the Amazon Hippolyta. Hippolytus has been trained since childhood by the king of Troezen, Pittheus.\nAt the opening of the play Aphrodite, Goddess of love, explains that Hippolytus has sworn chastity and refuses to revere her. Instead, he honors the Goddess of the hunt, Artemis. This has led her to initiate a plan of vengeance on Hippolytus. When Hippolytus went to Athens two years previously Aphrodite inspired Phaedra, Hippolytus' stepmother, to fall in love with him.\nHippolytus appears with his followers and shows reverence to a statue of Artemis, a chaste goddess. A servant warns him about slighting Aphrodite, but Hippolytus refuses to listen.\nThe chorus, consisting of young married women of Troezen, enters and describes how Theseus's wife, Phaedra has not eaten or slept in three days. Phaedra, sickly, appears with her nurse. After an agonizing discussion, Phaedra finally confesses why she is ill: she loves Hippolytus. The nurse and the chorus are shocked. Phaedra explains that she must starve herself and die with her honor intact. However, the nurse quickly retracts her initial response and tells Phaedra that she has a magical charm to cure her. However, in an aside she reveals different plans.\nThe nurse, after making Hippolytus swear not to tell anyone, informs Hippolytus of Phaedra's desire and suggests that Hippolytus consider yielding to her. He reacts with a furious tirade and threatens to tell his father, Theseus, everything as soon as he arrives. Phaedra realizes disaster has fallen. After making the chorus swear secrecy, she goes inside and hangs herself.\nTheseus returns and discovers his wife's dead body. Because the chorus is sworn to secrecy, they cannot tell Theseus why she killed herself. Theseus discovers a letter on Phaedra's body, which falsely asserts that she was raped by Hippolytus. Enraged, Theseus curses his son either to death or at least exile. To execute the curse, Theseus calls upon his father, the god Poseidon, who has promised to grant his son three wishes. Hippolytus enters and protests his innocence but cannot tell the truth because of the binding oath that he swore. Taking his wife's letter as proof, Theseus exiles his son.\nThe chorus sings a lament for Hippolytus.\nA messenger enters and describes a gruesome scene to Theseus; as Hippolytus got in his chariot to leave the kingdom, a bull roared out of the sea, frightening his horses, which dashed his chariot among the rocks, dragging Hippolytus behind. Hippolytus seems to be dying. The messenger protests Hippolytus' innocence, but Theseus refuses to believe him.\nTheseus is glad that Hippolytus is suffering and about to die. But then the goddess, Artemis, appears and rages at Theseus for killing his own son; she brutally tells him the truth: there was no rape, Phaedra had lied, his son was innocent. Theseus is painfully devastated by this revelation. Hippolytus is carried in physically battered and barely clinging to life. In the last moments of the play, Hippolytus forgives his father, kind words are exchanged between father and son, and then Hippolytus dies.",

The Eagles offense struggled to get into a rhythm through the first quarter and a half, with Donovan McNabb misfiring on several passes.  Atlanta scored first with a 55-yard catch and run from Matt Ryan to Roddy White.  The Eagles tied the score when McNabb capped off a long drive with a 3-yard quarterback draw for a touchdown.  Philadelphia drove down the field and scored on a 36-yard David Akers field goal in just 45 seconds before halftime.  The Eagles continued to roll on their opening possession of the third quarter, scoring on a 16-yard run by Brian Westbrook to open up a 17-7 lead.  Atlanta drove to the Philadelphia 1-yard line in the third quarter, but Lito Sheppard intercepted a fade to the end zone.  In the fourth quarter, Philadelphia's offense failed to capitalize on yet another goal line situation, and instead settled for a field goal, giving Atlanta hope.  The Falcons responded with an impressive drive that ended in a touchdown pass to Roddy White, making it 20-14.  The Eagles went three and out and punted, but the officials ruled the punt was muffed by Adam Jennings and recovered by the Eagles.  Atlanta, out of timeouts, could not challenge the controversial call, and two plays later Westbrook broke a 39-yard touchdown to the left side to put the game away.  Westbrook rushed for 167 yards and two touchdowns and had 42 receiving yards.  McNabb had 253 passing yards and also ran for 25 yards.  The win was the 100th of Reid's career and the 500th in the history of the franchise.",

    "user_prompt": "In this task you are expected to write an SQL query that will return the data asked for in the question. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\ndisplay the employee name ( first name and last name ) and hire date for all employees in the same department as Clara excluding Clara.",

It then turns to seven friends as they start out on a road trip to Las Vegas, with Phil (JoJo Wright) recording the trip for his girlfriend Julia. The group hits a road block en route to their destination, prompting them to take a detour that results in several flat tires. The group decides that the women will remain behind to watch the truck while the men go to look for help. The men eventually come across a rest-stop motel that sells tires, introducing themselves to the gas attendant Brad and the shop owner Steve (Braxton Davis) and Norah (Dallas Lovato). Steve offers to not only fix the truck and pick up the girls, but to provide free alcoholic drinks, in addition to letting the group stay at the neighboring motel for the night. One of the group members, Todd (Dustin Harnish), is originally hesitant about the proposition, but eventually agrees to it. After a wild night of drinking and partying, the group falls asleep in the motel.\nThe group eventually wakes up the next morning/afternoon. At first everything appears normal, but it soon becomes clear that Steve and his cohorts are nowhere to be found on the premises. None of the friends remembers much about what happened the previous night. And four of the friends (Jordan, Brandy, Ryan, Andy) wake up realizing they're tied up or otherwise physically incapacitated. Jordan is tied up to a chair in the bathroom next to the bathtub, with a bucket on his arm and an electric wire tied to his hand. Brandy is tied up in the bathtub. Ryan is tied to a chair in his room, and Anna is tied up on the bed, at her hands and her feet. At first the friends believe this to be some sort of bad joke, but when Todd and Claire witness Phil being intentionally decapitated by Brad, it becomes clear that Steve, Brad, Norah and Chloe are actually cruel, sadistic sociopaths, (who call themselves \"the helpers\") intent on torturing and murdering the group. Claire (Kristen Quintrall) and Todd are locked in their motel room and are forced to watch while their friends get murdered one by one. The helpers go into Anna and Ryan's room and reveal that each end of Anna's body is chained to a car, and they will drive the cars and rip her body in half. They do so, while Ryan is tied up and unable to stop them. They then go into Jordan and Brandy's room and explain that the wire attached to Jordan's arm will be lowered into the water in the bathtub by placing rocks in the bucket hanging from his arm, electrocuting Brandy. Brandy is presumed to be killed (actually just knocked out) from being electrocuted four times, while Jordan's arm with the wire was forcibly placed in the water. The men remove Brandy from the tub and leave Jordan with Norah. Norah taunts Jordan, who then pushes Norah into the tub and electrocutes her with the wire, killing her. He then checks to see if Brandy is still alive and after reviving her, they both escape. Todd and Claire also manage to successfully escape from their room. However, Todd and Claire are caught while attempting to flee and are brought back to the complex. The helpers bring out Ryan (still tied to the chair) and shoot him dead in front of the others, and then chain Claire to the cars as they did to Anna, threatening to rip her body in half, unless she admits that her father was the abusive owner of an orphanage. She admits that her father was indeed the owner of an orphanage. It's eventually revealed that the three murderers used to live in an orphanage run by Claire's father where they were terribly abused and beaten, with the murderers intentionally setting the group up to come by the motel. They found the motel/gas station, killed the employees, and took it over. Then they placed road detour signs on the road, and placed sharp objects to puncture the cars tires. It is also revealed that before they left the orphanage, they burned it down, as the news described in the opening scene of the movie. Hence, the murderers main motive for their barbarism is revenge against Claire's father. They knew that the group was going on a road trip because Phil's girlfriend, Julia, was one of them. Jordan, Brandy, Todd, and Claire manage to escape. The film ends with a scene \"six months later\" where \"the helpers\" are working at another gas station, asking their customers if they need any help.",

A 6'0\", 215-lb. running back from Texas Tech, Taylor played for five NFL seasons as a running back and kick returner. He spent his first three seasons as a member of the Giants, and spent his final two split between the Giants, the New York Jets, and the Los Angeles Raiders. As the starting running back for the Giants, he led the team in rushing in 1979 and 1980.

The police also accused Smith of physical assault and using offensive language. Race relations had been growing more tense over the year as Newark Mayor Hugh Addonizio announced a series of decisions that had angered the African-American community. Some of the residents who were living across the street from where the arrest took place walked out of their homes to watch the incident. Smith was badly beaten. As the police hauled him to the Fourth Precinct station, word spread within the community about what was happening. African-American taxi drivers sent out reports through their radios. A crowd slowly gathered to monitor and protest Smith's treatment. Word quickly spread about the arrest and what was taking place inside the station.Julian Zelizer: On July 12, 1967, riots erupted in Newark, New Jersey, after an African-American man was pulled over and beaten by two white policemenThe fiftieth anniversary of the riots is a reminder that we still face some of the same issues of racism in policing and criminal justice, writes Zelizer \n Question:There have been reforms to policing, public attitudes about race have changed, and the growth of _-American representation has changed the political dynamics surrounding these issues.",

The 160 and 180 having video output allowing them to drive an external monitor. In addition, the PowerBook 180 had a superb-for-the-time active-matrix grayscale display, making it popular with the Mac press. In 1993, the PowerBook 160 was the first PowerBook with a color screen, later followed by the PowerBook 180. In 1994, the last true member of the 100-series form factor introduced was the PowerBook 150, targeted at value-minded consumers and students. The PowerBook 190, released in 1995, bears no resemblance to the rest of the PowerBook 100 series, and is in fact simply a Motorola 68LC040-based version of the PowerBook 5300 (and the last Macintosh model to utilize a Motorola 68k-family processor). Like the 190, however, the 150 also used the 5300 Integrated Drive Electronics-based logic-board architecture.

For example, in 1726, the British governor of New York exacted a promise from the Iroquois to return all runaway slaves who had joined them. This same promise was extracted from the Huron Nation in 1764, and from the Delaware Nation in 1765, though there is no record of slaves ever being returned. Numerous advertisements requested the return of African Americans who had married Indigenous Americans or who spoke an Indigenous American language. The primary exposure that Africans and Indigenous Americans had to each other came through the institution of slavery. Indigenous Americans learned that Africans had what Indigenous Americans considered 'Great Medicine' in their bodies because Africans were virtually immune to the Old-World diseases that were decimating most native populations. Because of this, many tribes encouraged marriage between the two groups, to create stronger, healthier children from the unions.",

The ritual is unknowingly witnessed by Sylvia, a young girl who has been observing them from the trees. Sylvia is eventually spotted by one of the members and is dragged in front of the group. She manages to run away but is soon caught and raped by several of the cult members. The next morning, Sylvia emerges from the woods beaten and apparently raped. She is found by Mildred, the woman who runs the local bakery, and Pete, Sylvia's younger brother. They return Sylvia home to her grandfather, Doc Banner. Mildred seeks help from her boyfriend, leader of the construction crew working on the nearby dam which has bought up most of the town leaving it deserted. The cult members' van breaks down so they elect to remain in the town. They buy pies from Mildred who explains that as most of the town is deserted and awaiting demolition they can stay in any vacant building they wish.Learning of the assault on Sylvia, Doc confronts the cult but they assault him and force him to take LSD. Pete intervenes and Doc is released. Enraged by the incident, Pete takes a shotgun to get revenge but encounters a rabid dog which he shoots. He takes blood from the dog and the next morning injects it into meat pies at the bakery, and sells them to the cult members. Back at their house, Horace and the others eat the meat pies. The others begin to show signs of infection, and eventually they lapse into animalistic behavior. The infected members then proceed to attack and kill each other in a feral rage. One of the female members of the group, Molly becomes terrified and rushes off into the night. Construction workers sent there by Mildred's boyfriend find Molly and take her with them. Molly uses her sex appeal to insinuate herself into their group, and she spends the rest of the night having sex with all of them. Afterwards Molly begins to show signs of infection, eventually biting one of the men. Two other construction workers are killed when they venture into the house of the hippies and encounter a now-crazed Horace, who hangs one of them and guts the other. Banner discovers what is going on when Horace attacks Mildred's car and leaving bloody hand-prints behind. Andy returns to the Banner house and hides out in their barn; after making peace with Sylvia, they are discovered in the barn by Pete, who admits what he's done. Andy explains that he didn't eat the pies, therefore not infected. Banner has informed others about the potential rabies epidemic, and the next day they are joined by Dr. Oakes. Banner, Oakes, and Mildred's boyfriend all discover that the entire construction crew is now infected with rabies. Oakes and the others are nearly killed by a large group of the infected before they reach a water-filled quarry, which frightens them off.Andy helps Sylvia and Pete escape after they discover Banner dead in the barn, impaled by a pitchfork. While running through the woods, they happen upon the pregnant hippie, who commits suicide after learning she has rabies. When they emerge from the woods, they discover Rollo and Horace lurking near the bakery; fortunately they become interested in each other, allowing the survivors to escape. Rollo and Horace clash, each of them armed, until Rollo impales Horace with a sword. Andy, Sylvia and Pete discover Mildred barricaded inside the bakery, but she is too afraid to let them inside. When she finally manages to undo the barricade, Andy is beheaded by a machete-wielding madman. Sylvia and Pete retreat with her to the basement of the bakery, but unfortunately they cannot lock the basement door. One of the infected gets inside, and Mildred shoots him in the head. They rush out of the bakery and try to drive away in Mildred's car, but crowds of the infected converge on them, overturning the car. Just then, Oakes arrives with reinforcements and they gun down the infected. Mildred, Sylvia, and Pete all emerge from the car, shaken but otherwise unharmed.[3]",

To avoid his grief, he buries himself in his work and ignores his new daughter, Gertie, while his father, Bart (George Carlin), takes a month off from work to care for her, but returns so that his son is forced to live up to his responsibility as a parent. Under the stress of a botched diaper change and a baby who will not stop crying, Ollie trashes his client Will Smith for his soon-to-be released film Independence Day in front of assembled reporters. The outburst costs him his job, so he moves in with his father in New Jersey. He eventually apologizes for ignoring his daughter, and attributes his public outburst to his grief.Blacklisted by all of New York City's public relations firms, Ollie has to work as a civil servant in the borough where he now lives with his father. Seven years later, in 2003, Gertie (Raquel Castro), now in elementary school, often coaxes him to rent films to watch. At the video store, they meet Maya (Liv Tyler), a graduate student and one of the store's clerks, whose uninhibited probing into Ollie's love life almost leads to their having casual sex. She soon becomes a part of their lives.As part of his job in the borough, Ollie speaks to a group of outraged citizens to win over their approval for a major public works project that will temporarily close a street in the neighborhood. His successful and enjoyable interaction with the crowd leads him to realize how much he misses the public relations work. He contacts Arthur (Jason Biggs), his one-time prot\u00c3\u00a9g\u00c3\u00a9, who sets up a promising interview.The prospect of moving to New York creates tension among Ollie, Gertie, Bart, and Maya, especially when he says that his interview is on the same day as Gertie's school talent show. She yells at him, saying she hates him and that she wishes he had died instead of her mom. He claims he hates her right back, and says she and Gertrude took his life away and he just wants it back. He immediately regrets it and tries to apologize, but the damage is done and she pushes him away and runs to her room, crying. A few days later he and Gertie finally patch things up, and she accepts the fact that they will be moving to New York. While waiting to be interviewed, he has a chance encounter with Will Smith (playing himself), the man he trashed at his public outburst years before. Smith has no idea who Ollie is, but the two have a conversation about work and children that persuades Ollie to skip the interview and leave.Ollie rushes to make it to Gertie's Sweeney Todd performance at the last moment. The film ends with him, Gertie, Bart, Maya, and the rest celebrating at the bar. He and Maya hint at possible feelings for each other before being interrupted by Gertie. He holds her and says that they are staying in New Jersey because he did not take the job. She asks why he did so if he loved it so much.

A simple rule of thumb to decide whether a question is a factoid or not is to see if two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage.\nAmbitious high school senior Matthew Kidman (Emile Hirsch) has been accepted to Georgetown University, but cannot afford the tuition. He has raised $25,000 in order to bring a brilliant Cambodian student, Samnang, to study in the United States, but finds little else truly memorable about his high school experience. His life suddenly changes when charismatic Danielle (Elisha Cuthbert) moves in next door. Matthew witnesses her undressing from his bedroom window, until she sees him and storms over, knocking on the door and introducing herself to his parents. They suggest to Matthew that he show Danielle around town.While driving around, Danielle stops the car and forces Matthew to get out and strip for her. The two get to know each other through weird adventures, which includes Matthew finding himself in his principal's pool. He and Danielle sneak away and pick up his friends before going to a party. When a few of Matthew's athlete classmates attempt to get him away from Danielle and kick him out of the party, he finds the courage to walk right up and kiss her. Matthew's world is suddenly rocked the next day when his friend Eli informs him that Danielle is an adult film actress.On Eli's advice, Matthew takes Danielle to a sleazy motel. Danielle, insulted, realizes that he has discovered her past and abruptly ends the relationship. Matthew later attempts to apologize and reconcile, but Danielle believes that she will never be able to escape her past and decides to return to the adult industry. Matthew tracks Danielle down at an adult film convention in Las Vegas where Kelly (Timothy Olyphant), a porn producer and Danielle's ex, menacingly warns Matthew not to interfere with his business. Matthew ignores him, convincing Danielle both to leave the adult industry and to begin their relationship anew.Next morning, Kelly furiously abducts Matthew from school and assaults him, saying that Danielle's failure to film has cost him $30,000. Kelly offers to let Matthew erase his debt by stealing an award statuette from porn mogul Hugo Posh (James Remar), but once Matthew has entered the house Kelly calls in a burglary report and leaves the premises. Matthew narrowly avoids the police and rushes to a scholarship award dinner. High on ecstasy that Kelly gave him as aspirin, he gives a deeply sentimental speech but loses out on the scholarship.Kelly exacts further revenge by stealing all the money Matthew raised for Samnang. Matthew fears that he will be implicated in the crime and expelled from school. He turns to Danielle for help in recouping his losses. Danielle calls in two friends from her porn star days, and they agree to make a video for Hugo Posh on prom night using Matthew's classmates as actors. After the successful shoot, Danielle and Matthew have sex in their limousine. Despite Danielle's past, it is the first time she has truly made love.The next morning Eli calls Matthew, panicked because the prom night tape has been stolen, jeopardizing their hopes of financial recovery. Matthew enters his home to find Kelly (and the stolen tape) in his home, along with his parents and Principal Salinger. Kelly, in private, tells Matthew that unless he is given half of all profits, he will play the tape immediately for Matthew's family. Matthew dares him to show the tape, asserting that he no longer cares about his \"now-ruined future,\" and Kelly obliges. Surprising everyone, Matthew and his friends have made a progressive, comprehensive sex ed tape rather than a porn film. With no more cards left to play, Kelly admits defeat as well as a grudging respect for Matthew.Hugo Posh and Matthew make millions from the video. Hugo Posh pays for Samnang to come to the USA, while Matthew has enough money to attend Georgetown and take Danielle to DC with him. Matthew's story ends with him getting the girl of his dreams and a chance at the future he has always wanted.",

Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning.\n Three years after the destruction of the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance has been driven from their former base on Yavin IV by the Galactic Empire. The Rebels, led by Princess Leia, set up their new base on the ice planet Hoth. The Imperial fleet, led by Darth Vader, continues to hunt for the Rebels  new base by dispatching probe droids across the galaxy.\nWhile investigating a potential meteor strike, Luke Skywalker is captured by a wampa. He manages to escape from its cave with his lightsaber, but soon succumbs to the brutally cold temperatures. The ghost of his late mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi, instructs him to go to the Dagobah system to train under Jedi Master Yoda. He is found by Han Solo, who uses the warmth of his dead tauntaun to keep Luke warm while he sets up a shelter. Han and Luke make it through the night and are rescued by Zev Senesca.\nOn patrol, Han and Chewbacca discover the meteor Luke had planned to investigate is actually a probe droid, which alerts the Empire to the Rebels  location. The Empire launches a large-scale attack, using AT-AT Walkers to capture the base. Han and Leia escape on the Millennium Falcon with C-3PO and Chewbacca, but their hyperdrive malfunctions. They hide in an asteroid field, where Han and Leia grow closer. Vader summons bounty hunters, including the notorious Boba Fett, to assist in finding the Falcon. Luke, meanwhile, escapes with R2-D2 in his X-wing fighter and crash-lands on the swamp planet Dagobah. He meets a diminutive creature who is revealed to be Yoda; after conferring with Obi-Wan's spirit, Yoda reluctantly accepts Luke as his pupil.\nAfter evading the Empire, Han sets a course for Cloud City, a floating colony in the skies of the planet Bespin. Cloud City is run by Han's old friend, Lando Calrissian. Unknowingly, the Millennium Falcon has been tracked by Boba Fett; shortly after they arrive, Lando leads the group into a trap and they are handed over to Darth Vader. Vader plans to use the group as bait to lure out Luke, intending to capture him alive and take him to the Emperor. During his training on Dagobah, Luke sees a premonition of Han and Leia in pain and, against Yoda's wishes, leaves to save them.\nVader goes back on his agreement with Lando and takes Leia and Chewbacca into custody. He intends to hold Luke in suspended animation and, as a test, freezes Han alive in a block of carbonite. Vader hands the frozen Han over to Fett, who intends to leave for Tatooine to deliver Han to Jabba the Hutt and claim the bounty on Solo's head. Lando, who was forced into cooperating with the Empire, initiates an escape and frees Leia and the others. They try to save Han but are unable to stop Fett. They then flee Cloud City in the Falcon.\nLuke arrives at Cloud City and falls into Vader's trap. The two engage in a lightsaber duel that leads them over the city's central air shaft where, as his mentors warned, Luke proves to be no match for Vader who severs Luke's right hand, causing him to lose his weapon. After Luke refuses to join Vader against the Emperor, Vader reveals that he is Luke's father. Horrified, Luke falls through the air shaft. He is ejected beneath the floating city and makes a desperate telepathic plea to Leia, who senses it and persuades Lando to return for him in the Falcon. R2-D2 repairs the Falcon's hyperdrive, allowing them to escape the Empire.\nLater, aboard a Rebel medical frigate, Luke's amputated hand is replaced with a robotic prosthetic. Lando and Chewbacca set off for Tatooine in the Falcon in order to save Han. As the Falcon departs, Luke, Leia, R2-D2, and C-3PO look on and await word from Lando.",

It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years. \nStory: The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean.

Sediments are different sizes of rock particles. Boulders are sedi- ments; so is gravel. At the other end, silt and clay are also sediments. Weathering causes rocks at the Earths surface to change form. The new minerals that form are stable at the Earths surface. It takes a long time for a rock or mountain to weather. But a road can do so much more quickly. If you live in a part of the world that has cold winters, you may only have to wait one year to see a new road start to weather (Figure Mechanical weathering breaks rock into smaller pieces. These smaller pieces are just like the bigger rock; they are just smaller! The rock has broken without changing its composition. The smaller pieces have the same minerals in the same proportions. You could use the expression a chip off the old block to describe mechanical weathering! The main agents of mechanical weathering are water, ice, and wind. Rocks can break apart into smaller pieces in many ways. Ice wedging is common where water goes above and below its freezing point (Figure 9.2). This can happen in winter in the mid-latitudes or in colder climates in summer. Ice wedging is common in mountainous regions. This is how ice wedging works. When liquid water changes into solid ice, it increases in volume. You see this when you fill an ice cube tray with water and put it in the freezer. The ice cubes go to a higher level in the tray than the water. You also may have seen this if you put a can of soda into the freezer so that it cools down quickly. If you leave the can in the freezer too long, the liquid expands so much that it bends or pops the can. (For the record, water is very unusual. Most substances get smaller when they change from a liquid to a solid.) Abrasion is another type of mechanical weathering. With abrasion, one rock bumps against another rock. Gravity causes abrasion as a rock tumbles down a slope. Moving water causes abrasion it moves rocks so that they bump against one another (Figure 9.3). Strong winds cause abrasion by blasting sand against rock surfaces. Finally, the ice in glaciers cause abrasion. Pieces of rock embedded in ice at the bottom of a glacier scrape against the rock below. If you have ever collected beach glass or pebbles from a stream, you have witnessed the work of abrasion. Sometimes biological elements cause mechanical weathering. This can happen slowly. A plants roots grow into a crack in rock. As the roots grow larger, they wedge open the crack. Burrowing animals can also cause weathering. By digging for food or creating a hole to live in the animal may break apart rock. Today, human beings do a lot of mechanical weathering whenever we dig or blast into rock. This is common when we build homes, roads, and subways, or quarry stone for construction or other uses. Mechanical weathering increases the rate of chemical weathering. As rock breaks into smaller pieces, the surface area of the pieces increases. With more surfaces exposed, there are more places for chemical weathering to occur. Lets say you wanted to make some hot chocolate on a cold day. It would be hard to get a big chunk of chocolate to dissolve in your milk or hot water. Maybe you could make hot chocolate from some smaller pieces like chocolate chips, but it is much easier to add a powder to your milk. This is because the smaller the pieces are, the more surface area they have. Smaller pieces dissolve more easily. Chemical weathering is different than mechanical weathering. The minerals in the rock change. The rock changes composition and becomes a different type of rock. Most minerals form at high pressure or high temperatures deep within Earth. But at Earths surface, temperatures and pressures are much lower. Minerals that were stable deeper in the crust are not stable at the surface. Thats why chemical weathering happens. Minerals that formed at higher temperature and pressure change into minerals that are stable at the surface. Chemical weathering is important. It",

While clearing out her late husband's safe, she and Longdale found an 8mm film which appears to depict a real murder of a girl, but Mrs. Christian wants to know for certain.\nAfter looking through missing persons files, Tom discovers that the girl is Mary Ann Mathews (Jenny Powell), and visits her mother, Janet Mathews (Amy Morton). While searching the house with her permission, he finds Mary Ann's diary, in which she says that she went to Hollywood to become a film star. He asks Mrs. Mathews whether she wants to know the truth, even if it is a horrible truth. She says that she wants to know what happened to her daughter, so after reading the diary and a note left for her mother inside of it, he leaves it for her and then leaves.\nIn Hollywood, with the help of an adult video store employee called Max California (Joaquin Phoenix), Tom penetrates the underworld of illegal pornography. Contact with a sleazy talent scout named Eddie Poole (James Gandolfini) leads them to director Dino Velvet (Peter Stormare), whose violent pornographic films star a masked man known as \"Machine\" (Chris Bauer). To gain more evidence, Tom pretends to be a client interested in commissioning a hardcore bondage film to be directed by Velvet and starring Machine. Velvet agrees and arranges a meeting in New York City.\nAt the meeting, attorney Longdale appears and explains that Christian had contracted him to procure a snuff film. Longdale says that he told Velvet that Tom might come looking for them. Realizing that the snuff film was authentic, the private eye knows he is at risk. Velvet and Machine produce a bound and beaten Max, whom they abducted to force Tom to bring them the only surviving copy of the illegal film. Once he delivers it, but before he turns it over, they kill Max and beat Tom and then burn the film. As they are about to kill Tom, he tells them that Christian had paid $1 million for the film and that the reason Christian wanted the film made was for the simple reason that he had enough money to make it possible. Unbeknownst to them previously Velvet, Poole, and Machine received much less and that Longdale kept the major portion. In an ensuing fight, Velvet and Longdale are both killed; Tom wounds Machine and escapes.\nHe calls Mrs. Christian to tell her his discoveries and recommends going to the police, to which she agrees. Arriving at her estate, Tom is told that Mrs. Christian committed suicide after hearing the news. She left envelopes for the Mathews family and Tom: it contains the rest of his payment and a note reading, \"Try to forget us.\"\nTom decides to seek justice for the murdered girl by killing the remaining people involved. Tracking down Eddie, Tom takes him to the shooting location and tries to kill him. Eddie shows no remorse for his role in the murder and taunts Tom for being unable to go through with it. He calls Mrs. Mathews to tell her the truth about her daughter's fate and asks a devastated Janet for her permission to punish those responsible, to which she says yes. With that, he returns and pistol whips Eddie to death. After burning his body and the pornography from his car, Tom traces Machine and attacks him at his home.

As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning.\n Famed novelist Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is the author of a successful series of Regency romance novels featuring a character named Misery Chastain. Wanting to focus on more serious stories, he writes a manuscript for a new novel that he hopes will launch his post-Misery career. While traveling from Silver Creek, Colorado to his home in New York City, he is caught in a blizzard and his car goes off the road, rendering him unconscious. Paul is rescued by a nurse named Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), who brings him to her remote home. When Paul regains consciousness he finds himself bedridden, with both his legs broken as well as a dislocated shoulder. Annie claims she is his \"number one fan\" and talks a lot about him and his novels. As a reward for saving him, Paul gives Annie his new manuscript which she saved from the wreckage. While feeding him, she is angered by the profanity in the new manuscript and spills soup on him but regains control and apologizes. She buys a copy of Paul's most recently published book, Misery's Child, giving glowing praise to Paul as she progresses through the book. However, when Annie discovers that Misery dies at the end of the book she flies into a rage, almost smashing a table on Paul's head. She reveals that she lied about calling his agent and the authorities; nobody knows where he is. Annie leaves and Paul tries to escape from his room, but she has locked the door.\nThe next morning, Annie forces Paul to burn his latest manuscript. When he is well enough to get out of bed, she insists he write a new novel entitled Misery's Return, in which he brings the character back to life. Paul complies, believing Annie might kill him otherwise. He also tells her he will use Annie's name in the book in appreciation of her nursing him back to health. However, having found a way of escaping his room, he sneaks out when Annie is away and begins stockpiling his painkillers. He tries poisoning Annie during a candlelit dinner, but fails when she accidentally spills her drugged wine. During another venture out of his room, Paul finds a scrapbook of newspaper clippings about Annie's past. He discovers that she was suspected and tried for the deaths of several infants, but the trial crumbled due to lack of evidence. Paul also learns that Annie quoted lines he had written in his Misery novels during her trial. Annie later drugs Paul and straps him to the bed. When he wakes, she tells him that she knows he has been out of his room and breaks his ankles with a sledgehammer to prevent him from trying to escape again.\nThe local sheriff, Buster (Richard Farnsworth), is investigating Paul's disappearance. When a shopkeeper informs the sheriff he has sold Annie considerable quantities of typing paper, Buster surmises Paul must be at the Wilkes farm. Buster pays Annie a visit, who permits the sheriff to inspect the residence. When Buster finds Paul drugged and hidden in the basement, Annie fatally shoots Buster and tells Paul that they must die together. He agrees, on the condition that he must finish the novel in order to \"give Misery back to the world\". While she gets his chair, Paul conceals a can of lighter fluid in his pocket.\nWhen the book is done, he reminds Annie it is his practice to have a single cigarette and a glass of champagne after finishing a novel. When Annie gives these things to Paul, he tells her that this time, he will need a second glass, for her. As Annie gets a second glass, Paul soaks the manuscript in the lighter fluid. When Annie returns with the glass he sets the manuscript on fire, giving him the chance to hit Annie over the head with the typewriter. Paul and Annie fight and Annie is killed.\nEighteen months later, Paul, now walking with a cane, meets his publishing agent Marcia (Lauren Bacall) in a restaurant in New York City. The two discuss his first non-Misery novel. Marcia tells him about the positive early buzz which Paul does not care about, saying he wrote the novel for himself. Marcia asks if he would consider a non-fiction book about his captivity, but Paul declines. While at the restaurant, he imagines the waitress as Annie. The waitress says she is his \"number one fan\", to which Paul uncomfortably responds \"That's very sweet of you\".",

He tries to get out of writing his 1000 word essay by making up a lie, but he gets caught by his English teacher, Ms. Phyllis Caldwell, who alerts his parents, Harry and Carol Shepherd. He is given three hours to submit his essay, otherwise he will fail English and go to summer school. In a rush to turn it in, he accidentally forgets it in the limousine of Hollywood producer Marty Wolf, who gives him a ride to the community college to turn it in after he is hit by the limousine. Marty initially attempts to give it back to him, but when he sees that it is excellent, it inspires him, and he decides to keep it for himself.Jason realizes his essay is missing and tries to explain what happened when he met Marty, but neither his parents or Ms. Caldwell believe him, and he is sent to summer school. Later, after a disgusting first day there, he and his best friend, Kaylee, go to see a film, and upon watching the previews, they realize that Marty has plagiarized his essay and is turning it into a film. They fly to Los Angeles to confront him, as Jason is determined to convince his parents that he truly wrote his essay. Upon their arrival, they trick the limo driver and struggling actor Frank Jackson into giving them a ride to Marty's studio, where Jason creates a distraction, with help from Kaylee, that tricks its receptionist, Astrid Barker, into letting him speak with Marty in his office. Jason sneaks into there to convince him to call his father and tell him that he stole the essay, but instead he \"accidentally\" burns it and removes him and Kaylee from his office. Angered, they plan to inconvenience him until he admits to having stolen it. Frank, having discovered their true identities, joins them in their plan, as he has had a troubled history with Marty. After gathering information about his cruel and abusive treatment of his employees, they sabotage him by going as far as pouring blue dye in his pool and orange food coloring in his shampoo, putting super glue on his headset, sending him to a child's birthday party where he is mistaken for the hired clown and beaten up by the young guests, and modifying the controls to his car. Their tampering with his car causes numerous controls to perform the incorrect function, such as the brake pedal sounding the horn and the radio playing \"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\" as a way of mocking his blue skin. Struggling to control his car, he stops just behind a monster truck, but is later rear ended by an old lady, whom he had insulted earlier. He accidentally crashes into the monster truck, causing its driver, a wrestler known as \"The Masher\", to destroy his car in anger.These pranks cause Marty to miss his appointment with his boss and the president of Universal Pictures, Marcus Duncan. After another film produced by Marty, Whitaker and Fowl, proves to be a critical and commercial failure, Duncan loses confidence in him and threatens to pull production for Big Fat Liar. Jason approaches Marty and agrees to help him in exchange for his confession to having stolen the story. Guided by Jason, he makes a successful presentation which convinces Duncan's wife, Shandra (Chris Ott), to green-light Big Fat Liar, but Duncan warns Marty that any mistakes will cause Universal to pull funding for it and end his career. Marty, however, betrays Jason again and kicks him and Kaylee out from their hiding place in a warehouse of Universal Studios. His assistant, Monty Kirkham, having grown tired of being bossed around and abused by him, decides to help Jason and Kaylee to expose him. They rally all of his employees and devise a plan to stop him once and for all.The next morning, as Marty (having either removed or concealed the blue skin-dye and orange hair-dye) heads to the studio to begin shooting, many of his employees cause him to be late through multiple mishaps. As Marty finally arrives at the studio, he witnesses Jason kidnapping his stuffed monkey, Mr. Funny Bones. After a chase across the studio, he childishly and prematurely celebrates his supposed victory, mocking Jason and telling him that he will never tell the truth, as well as admitting that he stole Jason's story, thinking that he will still get away with it. However, the altercation is then revealed to be caught on twelve different cameras and is witnessed by many people including his employees, the news media, Jason's parents, and Duncan. Disgusted that Marty would steal a story from a young boy, Duncan immediately fires him due to his acts of plagiarism and dishonesty. Jason thanks Marty for teaching him the importance of telling the truth. After escaping from him and reuniting with his parents, Jason finally re-establishes his trust with them.Universal later reproduces Big Fat Liar, utilizing the talents and skills of all those whom Marty had abused, and it is released in theaters, with Jason being credited during the closing credits for having written the original story. Meanwhile, Marty, having been stripped of his career, declares bankruptcy and begins his new job as a birthday clown. Unfortunately, he is recognized by The Masher, who orders his son, Darren, the birthday boy, to show Marty his \"nutcracker\" manoeuvre. Marty screams in horror as Darren charges at him and kicks his crotch, causing him to groan in pain.",

Kip, 32, is unemployed and boasts of spending hours in Internet chat rooms with \"babes\" and aspiring to be a cage fighter; their grandmother leads a secret life involving mysterious boyfriends and quad-biking in the desert. Napoleon daydreams his way through school, doodling ligers and fantasy creatures, and reluctantly deals with the various bullies who torment him, particularly the obnoxious sports jock, Don. Napoleon likes to make up stories about himself whilst having a sullen and aloof attitude.Napoleon's grandmother breaks her coccyx in a quad-bike accident and asks their Uncle Rico to look after the boys while she recovers. Rico, a middle-aged and flirtatious former athlete who lives in a campervan, treats Napoleon like a child. He uses the visiting opportunity to team up with Kip in a get-rich-quick scheme to sell numerous items door-to-door. Kip wants money to visit his Internet girlfriend LaFawnduh, while Rico believes riches will help him get over his failed dreams of NFL stardom and the loss of his girlfriend.Napoleon becomes friends with two students at his school: Deb, a shy girl who runs various small businesses to raise money for college; and Pedro, a bold yet calm transfer student from Juarez, Mexico. A friendship soon develops between the three outcasts. During this time, preparations begin for the high school dance. Pedro asks Deb to be his dance partner, which she accepts, while Napoleon chooses and attempts to persuade a reluctant classmate called Trisha to be his own date. Inspired by an election poster at the dance, Pedro decides to run for class president, pitting him against Summer Wheatley, a popular and snobby girl at the school. The two factions put up flyers and give out accessories to the students to attract voters. Kip, meanwhile, is head-over-heels in love since LaFawnduh has come to visit him from Detroit. She gives Kip an urban makeover, outfitting him in hip-hop regalia.Rico's ongoing scheme causes friction with Napoleon when Rico begins spreading embarrassing rumors about him, to evoke sympathy from his prospective customers. Rico later tries to sell Deb a breast-enhancement product, claiming it was Napoleon's suggestion, which causes her to break off their friendship. His scheme ends when he visits the wife of the town's martial arts instructor, Rex, to try and sell her the breast enhancements, but Rex walks in and beats him up after witnessing Rico's demonstration.On the day of the class president elections, Summer gives a speech before the student body, and then presents a dance skit with a school club. Pedro and Napoleon then discover that a skit was also required from them, and a despondent Pedro gives an unimpressive speech. Napoleon then gives the sound engineer a music tape given to him by LaFawnduh, and performs an elaborate dance routine to \"Canned Heat\" by Jamiroquai. Summer and her boyfriend, Don, are unimpressed, but the routine receives a standing ovation from all the other students.The film concludes with Pedro becoming the class president, LaFawnduh leaving with Kip on a bus for Michigan, Rico reuniting with his estranged girlfriend, Grandma returning from the hospital, and Napoleon and Deb making up and playing tetherball.In a post-credits scene, Kip and LaFawnduh are married in an outdoor ceremony in Preston. Napoleon, absent for the vows, arrives riding a horse, claiming that it is a \"wild honeymoon stallion\" that he has tamed himself. Kip flicks LaFawnduh's garter as a \"keepsake\" towards Napoleon, Rico, and Pedro, before he and LaFawnduh ride off across the fields.",

He spent his early adult years in Virginia Beach as a police officer. He plays the organ at church, has unenthusiastic sex with his wife, Debbie, and spends his off-hours searching for his biological mother, who had placed him for adoption as a child. Steven locates his biological mother, but she rejects him.\nHe then quits the police force and moves to Texas and works for Sysco, the family business.\nAfter a car crash on the way to a homosexual tryst, Steven leaves his family and life behind, though he keeps in touch with his wife and young daughter, and explores the world as his true self   a gay man. He moves to Miami, where he finds a boyfriend, Jimmy, and they adopt a luxurious lifestyle. To keep themselves in the style to which they have become accustomed, Steven becomes a con man. Steven is pursued by the police, and, after jumping off a parking garage, is sent to prison, where he falls in love with inmate Phillip Morris.\nSteven cannot bear to be separated from Phillip. After being released, he helps get Phillip freed from prison by posing as a lawyer, then attains wealth by fraudulently acquiring a position as Chief Financial Officer of a large medical management company called USAMM.\nSteven eventually is caught embezzling. While in the police car he reminisces about Jimmy in Florida dying of AIDS. He asks the police for Phillips insulin and injects himself. He goes back to prison, Phillip is also sent to prison as an accomplice and angrily tells Steven he never wants to see him again. Months later, Phillip learns from another inmate that Steven is dying of AIDS. Heartbroken, Phillip calls Steven while he is in the infirmary and confesses that, while he is still upset with Steven for lying to him, he still loves him. Phillip is later told that Steven has died.\nSometime later, Phillip is taken to meet with his lawyer and finds Steven waiting for him. Steven describes how he faked dying of AIDS, to be allowed to see Phillip again, and promises never to lie to him again. He runs one last con to break Phillip out of prison, only to be caught when he runs into an old co-worker.\nThe end of the movie explains that the real-life Phillip Morris was released from prison in 2006; but Steven was given a life sentence and is in 23-hour lockup, only having one free hour a day to shower and exercise, which the film implies to be because an official involved in the sentencing had a nephew who was conned by Morris.\nThe last scene shows Steven laughing joyfully while running across the prison yard, guards in pursuit, in another attempt to be with Phillip.",

Political and financial crises in 1997, shattered the Czech Republic's image as one of the most stable and prosperous of post-Communist states. Delays in enterprise restructuring and failure to develop a well-functioning capital market played major roles in Czech economic troubles, which culminated in a currency crisis in May. The formerly pegged currency was forced into a floating system as investors sold their Korunas faster than the government could buy them. This followed a worldwide trend to divest from developing countries that year. Investors also worried the republic's economic transformation was far from complete. Another complicating factor was the current account deficit, which reached nearly 8% of GDP. In response to the crisis, two austerity packages were introduced later in the spring , which cut government spending by 2.5% of GDP. Growth dropped to 0.3% in 1997, \u22122.3% in 1998, and \u22120.5% in 1999. The government established a restructuring agency in 1999 and launched a revitalization program - to spur the sale of firms to foreign companies. Key priorities included accelerating legislative convergence with EU norms, restructuring enterprises, and privatising banks and utilities. The economy, fueled by increased export growth and investment, was expected to recover by 2000.",

You can create a question about characters, events, facts and beliefs, etc. Your question should be specific, try not to use pronouns instead of full names. As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning.\n The film opens in early 1980s Canada where teenager Martin Asher (Paul Dano) is seen ambling about a bus station, seemingly uncertain of his destination. He befriends another teen on the bus, Matt Soulsby (Justin Chatwin) and the two talk about their plans for the future. When their bus breaks down, the two acquire a car from a nearby garage. While Martin is driving, a tire blows. Matt struggles to change the tire and Martin comments on how he and Matt are both about the same height, and kicks Matt into the path of an oncoming truck. He is last seen toting Matt's guitar and walking away singing in a voice similar to Matt's.\nTwenty years later, a successful FBI profiler, Illeana Scott (Angelina Jolie), is summoned to help out Canadian law enforcement in Montreal, to apprehend Asher, who has been killing people for years and assuming their identities as he travels across North America. Scott has to adjust to working in a strange city with a police team that she does not really fit in with.\nOn a ferry to Quebec City, Martin's mother (Gena Rowlands) recognizes her son. After docking she locates a police officer and tells him that she saw her son on the ferry. Upon telling the officer her son died 19 years ago, she discusses the matter with a city official. She is convinced the man she saw was her son, and exclaims to the officer that her son is \"dangerous\". Based on Mrs. Asher's statement, the body believed to be that of her son is exhumed for an autopsy.\nThe team meets with art salesman James Costa (Ethan Hawke), an eyewitness who saw Asher kill his last victim. Costa makes a drawing of Asher and, within a couple of days, Asher's apartment is found. Scott discovers Asher's next target is Costa, so protecting him is priority number one. During the time they spend together, Scott and Costa begin to develop feelings for each other, though Scott refuses to become involved with him because of the ongoing case.\nAsher flees with Costa as a hostage and Scott pursues them. Scott sees Asher die in a car accident and the case is closed. As Scott is packing up, preparing to return home, Costa visits her in her hotel room. Without saying anything, he undresses her and they make passionate love on a chest of drawers and the bed, surrounded by gruesome crime scene photos. The next morning, Scott awakes to find herself partly covered in Costa's blood. At first, she fears he is dead, but then he awakes and they discover he had merely popped the stitches in his arm that he received after the auto accident.\nAs Costa's stitches are repaired in the hospital, Scott is called down to the morgue as Mrs. Asher has come to identify the burned body of her son, killed in the accident. She says the body is not her son. Mrs. Asher and Scott realize that Asher is still alive. Mrs. Asher is shocked, leaves the morgue, and goes to the elevator, and Scott chases after her. Before Scott can reach her, the elevator door closes. Scott descends the stairs, hoping to intercept Mrs. Asher on the ground floor. When the elevator door opens, Scott sees Costa covered in blood, having killed Mrs. Asher - who Scott realizes is Costa's mother. The police try to capture Asher who escapes the hospital. Scott returns to her hotel room and frantically washes herself, in a state of manic disgust. An investigation shows that the man who died in the car accident, who the real Asher had identified as Asher, was actually Christopher Hart (Kiefer Sutherland), a drug dealer and art thief to whom Asher owed $80,000, and whom Asher murdered. The Montreal police chase Asher, but he escapes in a train station and boards a train headed east of Montreal, meanwhile setting up his next victim, a sports talent scout. After that, he calls Scott on the phone and taunts her. Scott admits to having consensual sex with Asher, and is consequently fired from the FBI.\nSeven months later, Scott is living in an desolate farmhouse by herself in Carlisle, Pennsylvania and looking heavily pregnant with Asher's twin boys. One day as she sits alone in her home, she discovers Asher has broken into her house. She frantically tries to escape, but Asher quickly overpowers her and then reveals he has found all the guns she had hidden throughout the house. Asher makes her tea and tells her they could start over and live together as a family, but a disgusted Scott tells him she does not want to. Enraged, Asher begins beating and choking her and eventually stabs her in her belly with a pair of scissors. Scott, seemingly unharmed by the stabbing, shocks Asher by quickly stabbing him in the heart with the same scissors. As Asher is on his knees looking at her in disbelief, Scott removes a prosthetic pregnant belly, and tells him the past seven months have been a carefully planned trap. He falls over, dead. The film ends with Scott calling the police, saying \"It's over,\" and staring out her window.",

Just 1:18 into the game Randall Cobb managed to make a punt-return TD over 80 yards to give the Packers the lead. The Vikings managed just 1 first down before the Packers defense forced them into another punt, Aaron Rodgers & co. took advantage of it and the lead went up to 14. 1:18 before the end of the first quarter the Vikings kicker Ryan Longwell missed a 52-yd field goal. The second quarter started the way the first went with a Packers score, Mason Crosby connected on a 25-yd FG. No more scoring happened in this half, Tramon Williams successfully intercepted a pass by Ponder, making it only the second highlight that quarter. The Vikings were shut down by the Packers defense by managing not to score the whole first half. At the start of the third quarter Rodgers found Jordy Nelson for a 17-yd TD pass to push the lead to 24-0. Later on, Adrian Peterson scored a TD after a 3-yd run to give Minnesota the only points in the game. The rest of the way was a one-sided affair, with the Packers scoring another three touchdowns. John Kuhn and Nelson for the second time gave Rodgers two more TD passes in this game. Rodgers watched the last 10:30 of the game from the bench, looking at his backup Matt Flynn, who did score a 3-yd run TD 4:33 before the end of the game. With this win the Packers went to 9-0 sweeping the Vikings in the season and dropping the Vikings to 2-7. Rodgers again had a good passing game with connecting on 23 of his 30 pass attempts. Nelson was next to Rodgers the player of the game with his two touchdowns. The Packers will now play home to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, while the Vikings play at home against Oakland.",

After his friend Annie tells him that John Gale has asked her to marry him, the circus strongman finds out that Oscar flirted with his wife, and threatens him. Oscar escapes in a hot air balloon, but is sucked into a tornado that takes him to the Land of Oz. There, he encounters a beautiful but naive witch, Theodora. She believes him to be a wizard prophesied to defeat a Wicked Witch who killed the King of Oz and take his place as the next king; the idea of being an immensely wealthy monarch makes Oscar immediately accept. En route to the Emerald City, Theodora falls in love with Oscar, though he does not reciprocate her feelings. They encounter the flying monkey in a blue uniform, Finley, who pledges a life debt to Oscar when he saves him from a lion. Oscar reveals his deception to Finley along the way, forcing him to help maintain the lie that he is a 'Wizard', much to Finley's irritation.At the Emerald City, Oscar meets Theodora's beautiful older sister Evanora, the Royal Advisor. Evanora tells him the Wicked Witch resides in the Dark Forest and can be killed by destroying her wand, the source of her powers; only then will Evanora consent to him becoming King of Oz. Oscar and Finley are joined en route to the forest by China Girl, a young, living china doll whose village and family were destroyed by the Wicked Witch's flying baboons. Oscar fixes the China Girl's broken legs with glue. They reach the forest and retrieve the wand, but they discover the \"Wicked Witch\" is really Glinda the Good Witch who identifies herself as the daughter of the late King, revealing that Evanora is the true Wicked Witch. Evanora sees this with her crystal ball and tricks the naive Theodora into thinking Oscar is trying to court all three witches. She offers the heartbroken Theodora a magic apple that she says will remove her bad feelings about Oscar; Theodora bites it and realizes that Evanora deceived both her and Oscar before she is transformed into a hideous, green-skinned witch. Glinda brings Oscar and his group to her kingdom in the south of Oz to escape Evanora's army of Winkies and flying baboons. She confides to Oscar that she knows that he's not really a wizard, but still believes he can help stop Evanora. As he reluctantly takes charge of an \"army\" of Quadlings, Tinkers, and Munchkins, Theodora enters Glinda's kingdom and angrily reveals her new, hideous appearance to Oscar. She threatens to kill him and his allies with the Emerald City's well-prepared army. Oscar despairs at his chances of victory. After telling China Girl about the exploits of his hero Thomas Edison, he conceives a plan that relies on trickery and makes preparations with Glinda and his group.Glinda and her subjects mount a fake attack on the Emerald City using an army of scarecrow puppets whose true nature is hidden by thick fog. The witches are tricked into sending their Flying Baboons through the deadly poppy fields that puts them into everlasting sleep. However, two of the Baboons and Evanora capture Glinda, who is then brought to the city square and chained. Oscar infiltrates the Emerald City with his allies but appears to abandon them in a hot air balloon which he loads with stolen gold. Theodora destroys the balloon with a fireball, but Oscar was never actually in the balloon. As the Wicked sisters prepare to kill Glinda, Oscar secretly reveals his engineered death to his friends. Using a hidden smoke machine and image projector, he presents a giant image of his face amid smoke and flame as his \"true form\", and calls upon \"the stars themselves\" (a fireworks display) to intimidate the wicked sisters. Evanora fearfully hides in the castle, while Theodora flies off on her broom after her attacks fail to hurt the \"invincible\" wizard. Oscar calls after her, telling her that she is welcome to come back if she overcomes her wickedness, but Theodora screams defiance at him and flies to the west, leaving Oscar saddened. China Girl frees Glinda, who engages in a magical duel with Evanora in the throne room. During the fight, Glinda destroys the Wicked Witch's emerald necklace that hides her true, aged, crone-like appearance. Defeated, the banished Evanora is rescued by the two remaining Flying Baboons, swearing revenge as she is carried into the east.Oscar, now the King of Oz, decides to continue using his projector to sustain the belief he is a powerful wizard. He also presents gifts to his friends: Master Tinker, who helped build his machines, receives Oscar's camping tool; Knuck, the grumpy Munchkin herald, receives a mask with a smiley face; the long-suffering Finley receives Oscar's friendship (at last) along with his top hat; and China Girl accepts her friends as her new family. Finally, Oscar takes Glinda behind the curtains of his projector, thanks her for making him a better person, accepts his life in Oz, and they kiss.",

Instead, political violence has a long history in the United States and not just from people drawn to Osama bin Laden and his successors' vision of global jihad. The suspected Dallas sniper who killed five police officers has been identified as Micah Xavier Johnson, a 25-year-old from Mesquite, Texas. The Dallas shootings, like the one carried out last year by Dylann Roof on a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, that left nine people dead, were politically motivated.Dallas attack seemingly first instance of deadly terrorism from extreme left in post-9/11 era, Peter Bergen and David Sterman sayDallas a reminder violent extremism isn't province of any one ideology, they say \n Question:Killing white police officers who are guarding a peaceful demonstration certainly qualifies as terrorism, in the same way that _'s attack on black churchgoers does.",

The day goes smoothly until Jack is visited by a collection agency, claiming that he owes $95,000 in debts to their online gambling site. He trusts a fellow colleague to take care of it (as he is convinced of some form of identity theft) and goes out for dinner with colleague Harry and potential employer, Bill Cox (Paul Bettany). After the meal, Harry leaves in a taxi and Jack gets in his car. Unexpectedly, Cox follows him into the back seat. Cox then goes on to tell Jack that his family is being held hostage at their home to ensure Jack's cooperation. He then points a gun to Jack's head and forces him to drive home.Upon their arrival, Jack sees that, although his family is unharmed, they are under heavy watch by Cox's henchmen. Jack is not told what to do until the next morning, when he is told that he must give Cox $10,000 each from the bank's 10,000 largest depositors ($100 million total). He is outfitted with audio and video devices in the form of a pen and a body microphone, making any intentions to resist useless.Once at work, Cox makes a surprise visit, reintroducing himself as Bill Redmond. Next, Jack gives him a tour of the facilities and security system. On the way back home, Jack attempts to bribe a henchman into betraying Cox, yet this only results in Cox killing the man. The Stanfields attempt an escape, but the plan fails just barely. In retaliation, Cox tricks the Stanfields' son Andy with a cookie containing nut products. Because he's allergic, Andy goes into anaphylactic shock. Cox withholds the treatment, (an EpiPen) until Jack acquiesces to their plan.The next day, Cox forces Jack to fire his secretary Janet Stone fearing she is growing suspicious. Jack downloads the files for the $100 million onto his daughter Sarah's iPod mini hard drive and then initiates a wire transfer to send the money to Cox's offshore accounts. Before leaving, Jack uses an employee's camera phone to take a picture of the account information on the screen. Cox then sets about wiping his tracks clean, deleting security data and surveillance tapes and using a virus to put the network on the entire building into disarray, setting Jack up to take the fall for embezzlement. Returning home, Jack finds the house empty except for Liam, one of Cox's men.Realizing Liam is still around for no reason other than to kill him, Jack turns to survival instinct; he pushes Liam over a chair, grabs a heavy glass blender, and viciously beats him in the head with three blows, killing him. He then tries to call Harry using Liam's unmonitored cell phone but cannot reach his friend. Instead, he sneaks into Harry's apartment to wait for his friend's return. Both Cox and Harry enter. Cox suddenly shoots Harry from behind, using the gun he had earlier confiscated from Jack. Because of this, along with a message planted on Harry's answering machine earlier by Beth as she is held at gunpoint, it appears that Jack killed Harry in a jealous rage over Beth.Jack runs to the only ally he has left: his \"fired\" secretary Janet. He asks her for help, and she provides him with transportation to a late-night branch of the bank at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. There, he uses the picture from the phone he took earlier to get access to Cox's account and calls him. Jack tells him that theres been a change of plans: he has hacked into his Cayman Island accounts and is stripping five accounts, $20,000,000 apiece. Cox tries forcing Jack to put the money back, but it is a futile threat. Jack informs Cox that he will get his money when he gets his family. Next, Jack tells Cox that he will call him when the banks open to make the exchange before hanging up on him. During the conversation, Jack hears the family dog in the background, and realizes that the family can be located and followed by the GPS tracking unit in the dog's collar. This leads him and Janet to an abandoned house. He leaves Janet on the road to call the police.Cox shoots one of his own henchman (Vel) who had compassion for the hostages and removed the Stanfield's tape gags after Andy begins to suffocate because he is unable to breathe properly with the tape gag over his mouth. Another henchman (Vince Vieluf) chases after Sarah, Jack runs into the chaser with Janet's car, hurling him into an RV, which then explodes, burning the RV, killing him and destroying Janet's car. Cox, seeing that the tide is turning against him, panics and takes Beth and Andy to the upper level of the house. Jack scales the side of the house, destroys a window and comes to rescue his wife and son, tackling Cox to the floor and forcing him to a final showdown. After a long and grueling struggle with Cox, Jack finally gains the upper hand, impaling him through the back with a pickaxe, and wins his family's freedom.",

In his autobiography, I, Me Mine, he recalls working on the melody on a piano, at the same time as Paul McCartney recorded overdubs in a neighbouring studio at London's Abbey Road Studios. Harrison suspended work on the song, believing that with the tune having come to him so easily, it might have been a melody from another song. In I, Me, Mine, he wrote that the middle eight \"took some time to sort out\".\nThe opening lyric was taken from the title of \"Something in the Way She Moves\", a track by Harrison's fellow Apple Records artist James Taylor. While Harrison imagined the composition in the style of Ray Charles, his inspiration for \"Something\" was his wife, Pattie Boyd. In her 2007 autobiography, Wonderful Today, Boyd recalls: \"He told me, in a matter-of-fact way, that he had written it for me. I thought it was beautiful ...\" Boyd discusses the song's popularity among other recording artists and concludes: \"My favourite [version] was the one by George Harrison, which he played to me in the kitchen at Kinfauns.\"Having begun to write love songs that were directed at both God and a woman, with his White Album track \"Long, Long, Long\", Harrison later cited alternative sources for his inspiration for \"Something\". In early 1969, according to author Joshua Greene, Harrison told his friends from the Hare Krishna Movement that the song was about the Hindu deity Krishna; in an interview with Rolling Stone in 1976, he said of his approach to writing love songs: \"all love is part of a universal love. When you love a woman, it's the God in her that you see.\" By 1996, Harrison had denied writing \"Something\" for Boyd. That year, he told music journalist Paul Cashmere that \"everybody presumed I wrote it about Pattie\" because of the promotional film accompanying the release of the Beatles' recording, which showed the couple together.",

The Chargers took the early lead in the first quarter, with a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Nick Novak. The Broncos grabbed the lead, when cornerback Cassius Vaughn returned an interception off Chargers' quarterback Philip Rivers 55 yards for a touchdown. The Chargers responded, with a 32-yard field goal by Novak. The Broncos extended their lead in the second quarter, with a 32-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. However, the Chargers would re-claim the lead, with a 2-yard touchdown run by Rivers, a 28-yard field goal by Novak, followed by a 42-yard touchdown pass from Rivers to wide receiver Malcom Floyd, giving San Diego a 23-10 halftime lead. The Broncos benched quarterback Kyle Orton in favor of Tim Tebow. After a scoreless third quarter, the Chargers added to their lead, with a 51-yard field goal by Novak. The Broncos responded, when Tebow scrambled for a 12-yard touchdown (with a two-point conversion run by running back Willis McGahee), then threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to running back Knowshon Moreno (with a failed two-point conversion attempt), to pull the Broncos to within 26-24 with just over three minutes left in the game.

Infected vampires are turned into Reapers, mutants immune to all vampire weaknesses with the exception of bright light. Unable to contain the Reapers, vampire lord Eli Damaskinos sends two emissaries, Asad and Nyssa, to seek the aid of vampire hunter Blade and his team, consisting of weaponsmith Abraham Whistler and his assistant Scud. Damaskinos introduces them to the Bloodpack, a group of vampires trained for the sole purpose of killing Blade. In addition to Asad and Nyssa, the Bloodpack consists of Reinhardt, Chupa, Snowman, Verlaine, her lover Lighthammer, and Priest. To keep them in line, Blade plants an explosive charge on the back of Reinhardt's head.\nOn Blade's advice, the team starts by investigating a local nightclub frequented by vampires. When they do encounter Reapers, they soon discover that their weapons and powers are completely ineffective. Blade is forced to kill Priest after he becomes infected, Lighthammer is wounded, Whistler deserts his post, and Scud barely survives a Reaper attack by using UV lights to scare them off.

While Ainsley is urinating, Sampson falls silent; Ainsley finds Sampson killed. He grabs his harpoon, only to be murdered by a monstrous being.During a Mardi Gras celebration in New Orleans, a group of friends including Ben and his best friend Marcus decide to go on a haunted swamp tour. They find the tour closed because the guide, Rev. Zombie, was sued for negligence. Rev. Zombie suggests they try a place farther down the street, owned by the over-the-top, inexperienced tour guide Shawn. Marcus decides to leave but changes his mind upon seeing two topless girls: Misty, a ditzy porn star, and Jenna, a bossy, boastful, up-and-coming actress. Their sleazy director, Doug Shapiro, is also present. Ben pays for himself and Marcus and Shawn leads them to his tour bus, where the other tourists, Jim and Shannon Permatteo, a Minnesota married couple, and the quiet, hot-tempered Marybeth are waiting.Shawn does not know what he is doing, which the others realize as they arrive at the swamp. Shapiro has Misty and Jenna strip down and film a scene for Bayou Beavers as everyone boards the boat, while a homeless swamp-dweller named Jack Cracker warns them away from the swamp. Shawn leads them through swamplands and past abandoned houses, including one where Victor Crowley, a deformed creature, lived. The boat hits a rock and begins sinking, leaving them stranded.As the crew walks through the woods, they encounter the shabby Crowley house, and Marybeth shares the legend of Victor Crowley. Victor was a deformed child with a rare disease, bullied by other kids and was kept hidden by his father, Thomas Crowley. One night a group of mean teenagers stumbled across the house and threw fireworks at it to scare Victor. The house began burning, and Thomas returned, causing the teens to flee. Victor was killed when Thomas accidentally hit him in the face with a hatchet while trying to break down the door. Marybeth claims that Victor roams the swamp at night, looking for his father. Marybeth then explains that they are not safe in the woods, but the crew do not believe her.As Jim and Shannon approach the house, Victor comes out of it and kills them, causing the group to flee. Marybeth shoots Victor with a handgun, but he gets up and resumes his pursuit. Shapiro splits from the group and is killed by Victor. The remaining survivors decide to return to the house where they can arm themselves.While at the house, Marybeth and Ben discover her brother and father's remains. Marcus, Shawn, Misty and Jenna hear a noise in a bush. Marcus goes to investigate and discovers that it was only a racoon. Victor then surprises the group and gets a hold of Jenna, then shreds her mouth off with a belt sander. Marybeth and Ben return and attack Victor. While the other survivors flee, Shawn tries fighting Victor, but instead is killed. Victor then kills Jenna.The survivors decide to lure Victor back to his house and set him on fire with the gasoline tanks in the shed. Ben goes into the shed to retrieve a gasoline tank while Misty stands guard and Marybeth and Marcus act as bait. Marybeth and Marcus discover that Misty is missing, and her corpse is thrown onto Ben by Victor. Ben finds a tank and throws it on Victor while Marybeth and Marcus set him on fire, but he is extinguished due to rain. They start running away, but Marcus is grabbed by Victor and killed. Victor grabs a gate pole and chases Ben and Marybeth, throwing it into Ben's foot. Marybeth bends the pole until it is pointed at Victor, who impales himself upon it and collapses, apparently killing him. Ben and Marybeth board Sampson's boat and flee; Marybeth is snared by seaweed and pulled underwater. She sees Ben's arm sticking into the water for her to grab, but is pulled up by Victor, who is holding a dying Ben's severed forearm. She screams in horror, as Crowley roars into her face, setting the opening for the next film.",

Against this Francis could muster about 70,000 men in his various armies. The campaign could not begin, however, until Henry and Charles had resolved their personal conflicts with Scotland and the German princes, respectively. On 15 May, Henry was informed by Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, that, after his raids, Scotland was no longer in a position to threaten him; he then began to make preparations for a personal campaign in France\u2014against the advice of his council and the Emperor, who believed that his presence would be a hindrance. Charles had meanwhile reached an understanding with the princes at the Diet of Speyer, and the Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg had agreed to join his invasion of France. By May 1544, two Imperial armies were poised to invade France: one, under Ferrante Gonzaga, Viceroy of Sicily, north of Luxemburg; the other, under Charles himself, in the Palatinate. Charles had gathered a combined force of more than 42,000 for the invasion, and had arranged for another 4,000 men to join the English army. On 25 May, Gonzaga captured Luxembourg and moved towards Commercy and Ligny, issuing a proclamation that the Emperor had come to overthrow \"a tyrant allied to the Turks\". On 8 July, Gonzaga besieged Saint-Dizier; Charles and the second Imperial army soon joined him.",

His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht D\u00fcrer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence.\nLess is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40.\nLochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral. One of D\u00fcrer's diary entries became key, 400 years later, in the 20th-century establishment of Lochner's identity. Only two attributed works are dated, and none are signed. His influence on successive generations of northern artists was substantial. Apart from the many direct copies made in the later 15th century, echoes of his panels can be seen in works by Rogier van der Weyden and Hans Memling. Lochner's work was praised by Friedrich Schlegel and Goethe for its qualities, especially the \"sweetness and grace\" of his Madonnas.",

REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya Dhobley\u2019s buildings are riddled with bullet holes, the scars of battles earlier this year when Somali troops and fighters from the Ras Kamboni militia, allied to the embattled government, routed Islamist militants from the frontier town. Gunmen draped in ammunition belts ride heavily armed 4x4s, maintaining a jumpy peace. The al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab rebels are now hunkered down just 20 km (12 miles) to the east in the village of Dagalama and 30 km (20 miles) to the south in Hawina. The scene is similar across many parts of southern Somalia where the United Nations declared a famine last month, putting 3.7 million Somalis, the majority of them in southern rebel-controlled regions, at risk of starvation. Abdullahi Abdisalam can only watch as the region\u2019s worst drought in decades decimates his livestock herd and pushes food prices beyond the reach of most, slowly squeezing the life out his small grocery shack. \u201cI had invested everything in those cattle. Most have died, the others are so skinny they\u2019re worthless,\u201d said Abdisalam, running his hand through a large sack of beans. He, however, is among the more fortunate, with a small, albeit ailing, business to fall back on. Dhobley was once a buzzing trading post, the entry point into Kenya, the region\u2019s biggest economy. Now the only people passing through are exhausted families trekking to the world\u2019s biggest refugee camp on the other side of the border. Across Somalia, harvests have failed. Nearly all the food available in Dhobley\u2019s local stores is imported. To bring it to Dhobley from the militant-controlled port of Kismayu, traders are forced to run a gauntlet of road-blocks at which \u201ctaxes\u201d are frequently extorted. Many opt to take long detours. The result is the same: higher prices. Mako Mohamud brings in dried grass from the more fertile Juba valley to Dhobley. \u201cAl Shabaab stop us on the road and ask if the grass is to feed cattle in government held areas. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s for Dhobley. I\u2019ll say it\u2019s for Afmadow. That\u2019s not far from here but under their control,\u201d the 32-year-old mother said. Few, however, can afford the fodder. At one of Dhobley\u2019s two boreholes, emaciated cattle, their skin hanging off jutting ribs, trip over the fresh carcass of a calf. Dhobley lies just five km (three miles) from the porous border with Kenya. But it\u2019s one-way traffic across the frontier as tens of thousands of Somalis flee a famine that is tightening its grip on the south of their country. The drought and famine have killed more than 29,000 children under the age of 5 in the last three months in southern Somalia alone, according to U.S. estimates. In a dusty compound on Dhobley\u2019s outskirts, Habiba Mahad Adan swatted flies away from the sunken, cloudy eyes of her severely malnourished four-year-old son, too weak to cry for food. \u201cI\u2019ve received nothing for my child,\u201d Aden said, contemplating the 100 km (60 miles) walk to Kenya\u2019s Dadaab refugee complex after already having trekked for three weeks through the scorched landscape. Even in areas now held by Somali troops and government-friendly militia, the sands shift constantly, deterring aid groups from entering. What is more, the border with Kenya is officially closed, complicating the overland delivery of aid. \u201cWe\u2019ve made the place safe. We\u2019ve been telling aid agencies that, but so far we\u2019ve received no emergency intervention,\u201d Abdinassir Serar, a local elder, told a high-level delegation from the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). While the humanitarian response to the famine in Somalia has focused on emergency food and shelter handouts, FAO has appealed for $70 million to help Somalis buy food, feed their livestock and stay in the country. Cash in return for work as well as seeds for the next harvest, with rains anticipated in October, might hold back the tide of refugees and cut a growing dependency on aid. \u201cThere is no alternative other than providing immediate cash relief to people and at the same time engage immediately to protect their resource base (livestock),\u201d said Luca Alinovi, head of FAO\u2019s Somalia program, in a patch of scrub littered with rotting cattle carcasses. A Somali refugee drives his donkeys at Kobe refugee camp, 60km (37 miles) from Dolo Ado, near the Ethiopia-Somalia border August 11, 2011. REUTERS/Thomas Mukoya Still waiting for cash commitments from donors, FAO says $70 million could provide seeds to 750,000 people ahead of the rains, help feed and vaccinate 42 million animals at risk of drought-related diseases and support almost 1 million people in return for work that might jump-start local economies. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear, we need to move assistance across the border (into southern Somalia),\u201d Cristina Amaral, FAO\u2019s head of emergency operations, told Reuters. If they do not, then it\u2019s only time before shopkeeper Abdisalam and tens of thousands of others like him contemplate the walk across the border, perhaps never to return.",

This set of new money, which was printed even before the war, became known in the Philippines as Mickey Mouse money due to its very low value caused by severe inflation.

She tells her younger sister, Susan \"Susy\" (Roberta Tovey) to tend to the door up. This is no ordinary family, as Susy had been reading a huge book, by Physics for the Enquiring Mind by Eric M. Roberts, highly advanced for somebody of such a young age - alike the bigger sister, who was reading Science Is Science, and it's grandfather who's reading a science-fiction comic. Ian is clumsy and stubles on entering... again. Ian has brought a present, but Dr. Who insists in showing him his last invention. Susy thinks that Ian is so stupid, he won't understand it, but they three go out to the street to check of the red phone booth. Ian is amazed about how big it's on the inside. The machine will transport everything in time and place.Barbara appears and jumps to Ian's arms. He steps back and sets the machine onto motion with the four of them inside. The scenery immediately changes: they are on a place of jungle twigs and burnt soil called Skaro. It's another planet. Susan is excited to have the opportunity to go around and investigate. She find a kind of alien flower. Barbara screams at the small statue of a crocrodile. On the mayhem, Ian falls onto the thing and breaks it.Susan find the lights of empty buildings. Barbara starts thinking that something terrible happened in that place, and that it's dangerous. Ian tells Dr. Who that he's expected at home, so that they must return. Finally, who obliges. Susan gets lost because she finds another of those beautiful flowers. She runs away because a hand has touched her, but nobody seems to believe her.Back at the phone booth, they cannot see anyone with their surveillance cameras, but Susy insists that she was touched on the shoulder. There are knocks on the door, which startle Ian, but there isn't anybody around. They try to leave, but can't, and when they step aside, Susan courageously picks up a small blue container - it's has four small tubes with a liquid inside.They go to the city, which looks empty. Dr. Who gets tired easily. They enter an empty home with different rooms. Ian's door is the only one which doesn't open automatically, as he needs to touch something. Barbara walks a long corridor, and it looks as though she's being watched. She ends up being trapped and screams. Susan sits on the spot to open up the door. Susy, Ian and Who follow a noise to a communication room. Dr. Who looks tired. When they turn around, the three of them find themselves surrounded by Daleks. Ian is left dizzy by the Daleks, who also took the object which they found. They reunite with Barbara in a room/cell.Temmosus (Geoffrey Toone), Antodus (John Bown), Dyoni (Yvonne Antrobus) and Elyon (Mark Petersen). Some of them believe the letter offering to be their friends - supposedly written by Susan. Who devises a plan to escape using Susan's cape as an insulator. At that moment, a Dalek appears to bring them food, they put food in their periscope and attack it by blinding its eye with the disgusting food. Ian gets into the blue Dalek. There is also the image of a kind of green claw, a proof of the mutations which have taken place in the . Susan leads the way, and pretends to be the blue Dale's prisoner. They are soon found out anyway, so they have to break the lift, but the blue Dalek with Ian inside can't get into it. Now we realise that finally, Ian unstuck the head and was able to leave it in time.The four humans arrive in time to tell the Thals that they cannot hide in the forst forever. In fact, the Daleks are planning to bomb all the planet. However, the Thals have become peaceful, too peaceful. It was war which destroyed the planet and caused all the destruction and polution in Skaro. The Thals insist, and even the death of one of them was not convincing. Dr. Who tells Ian to take Dyoni to the Daleks. The leader won't allow it, so that settles the matter: they will have to fightSusan and Ian with cross a mutant-infested swamp with some Thals. On their way, they find the tubes which are polluting the water. Elyon stays behind to take some samples of the water, when he is eaten by something from the river.The Daleks are reuniting: they want to destroy the Thals forever. The other four follow the pipes to some caves. There is a fight between the two remaining Thals, because one of them wants to go back and forget the city.Who was supposed te watch some cakes, but they get burnt, to Susan's disappointment. Two female ladies are looking at themselves in the mirror, which gives Who an idea. Ian has to jump over a cliff, which he does, but then one of the Thals seems to have second thoughts over the whole ordeal. With plenty of mirrors, Who and the thals will make the detectors useless. The Daleks start to move on. Dr Who and Susan are captured again. The Daleks start the countdown for the bomb.Finally, one of the Daleks decides that they must fight. Dr. Who offers his time machine if the Daleks don't explode the bomb, but the Daleks will figure it out how it works after having exploded the bomb. Susan, Ian and the two Thals enter the Dalek's castle and run away using another lift. Finally, the rest of the Daleks fight.They reach control room. Two Daleks destroy one another. The Daleks destroy the computer when trying to kill Ian. All the Daleks are dead - three seconds left, which Ian alleges it's his lucky number.Why fills up the energy of the time machine. The Thals appreciate what they have done for them. They give Ian the purple coat - which Ian uses.

Jane is ecstatic when Mrs. Reed, eager to be rid of the child, arranges for Jane to be sent to Lowood Institution, a charity boarding school for young girls, run by the disciplinarian Reverend Brocklehurst (Henry Daniell).Based on what Mrs. Reed has told him, Mr. Brocklehurst labels Jane a liar in front of her schoolmates and orders her to stand on a stool for hours on her first day of attendance. She is comforted and befriended by another student, Helen Burns (Elizabeth Taylor). Later, Jane protests when Brocklehurst orders that Helen's naturally curling hair be cut. Both are punished by being forced to walk circles in a courtyard during a downpour. Dr. Rivers (John Sutton), a sympathetic physician who periodically checks on the students, brings them inside, but it is too late for Helen, who dies that night.Ten years later, in 1840, 20-year-old Jane (Joan Fontaine) turns down Brocklehurst's offer of a teaching position. She advertises for and accepts a job as governess for a young girl named Ad\u00c3\u00a8le (Margaret O'Brien). When she arrives at Thornfield, a gloomy, isolated mansion, she initially thinks her employer is Mrs. Fairfax (Edith Barrett), who is only the housekeeper for the absent master.Jane goes for a walk one night, only to startle a horse into throwing and slightly injuring its rider, Edward Rochester (Orson Welles)\u00e2\u0080\u0094who she doesn't realize is her employer. When Jane arrives back at Thornfield, she discovers this fact, and Rochester calls her into his library to interview her.That night, Jane is awakened by strange laughter. She investigates, and discovers that Mr. Rochester's bed curtains are on fire. She rouses the sleeping man and they extinguish the fire without rousing anyone. Rochester bids her wait while he goes to another wing of the house, where mysterious seamstress Grace Poole (an uncredited Ethel Griffies) keeps to herself. When he returns, he tells Jane nothing other than that the matter is under control. The next morning, he leaves Thornfield.A winter and spring go by before he returns with a large group of guests. Jane is greatly saddened when Mrs. Fairfax discloses that everyone expects Rochester to marry Blanche Ingram (Hillary Brooke). However, Rochester confides to Jane his conviction that Miss Ingram is attracted only by his wealth.When a man named Mason (an uncredited John Abbott) of Spanish Town, Jamaica, arrives at Thornfield, Jane sees that Rochester is disturbed. That night, a scream awakens everyone. Rochester assures his guests it is just a servant's reaction to a nightmare, but after he sends them back to their rooms, he has Jane secretly tend a bleeding Mason, while he fetches a doctor. Jane assumes Grace is responsible. Rochester has the doctor take Mason away.Rochester has a private conversation with Blanche, in which he bluntly asserts that she is a gold digger. Offended, she and the guests leave. Unaware of this development, Jane broaches the topic of her future employment elsewhere after Rochester gets married. He reveals to Jane that he intends to marry her.During the wedding ceremony, an attorney intervenes and declares that Rochester has a wife still living, who is mentally ill and deranged. This is confirmed by Mason, Rochester's brother-in-law. Rochester calls off the marital ceremony and takes them back to Thornfield to reveal his insane spouse, who lives in a tower cell, guarded by Grace Poole. Jane rejects Rochester's offer to stay together without being married. She departs Thornfield.With her funds exhausted, Jane returns to Gateshead. She discovers that her aunt has suffered a stroke, caused by worry over the ruinous gambling habits of her son, who it is revealed has committed suicide. There is a reconciliation. After Mrs. Reed dies, Jane ponders what to do next, when she hears an anguished and beloved male voice from thin air calling her name.Jane travels to Thornfield and finds it in ruins. Mrs. Fairfax informs her that the lunatic escaped, set the place on fire, and fled to the roof. When Rochester tried to rescue her, she jumped and was killed. He was blinded when the burning staircase collapsed underneath him. With no other impediments, Jane joyfully returns to him. She narrates that, when their son was born, her husband's vision was sufficiently restored for him to see their child.",

She knew the number of the police station, and when the man at the other end answered, she cried to him. \"Quick! Come quick! Patrick's dead!\" \"Who's speaking?\" \"Mrs Maloney. Mrs Patrick Maloney.\" \"You mean Patrick Maloney's dead?\" \"I think so,\" she sobbed. \"He's lying on the floor and I think he's dead.\" \"Be right over,\" the man said. The car came very quickly, and when she opened the front door, two policemen walked in. She knew them both--she knew nearly all the men at that precinct. Briefly, she told her story about going out to the grocer and coming back to find him on the floor. While she was talking, crying and talking, Noonan discovered a small patch of congealed blood on the dead man's head. He showed it to O'Malley who got up at once and hurried to the phone. Later, one of the detectives came up and sat beside her. Did she know, he asked, of anything in the house that could've been used as the weapon? Would she mind having a look around to see if anything was missing--a very big spanner, for example, or a heavy metal vase. They didn't have any heavy metal vases, she said. \"Or a big spanner  ?\" She didn't think they had a big spanner. But there might be some things like that in the garage. The search went on. She knew that there were other policemen in the garden all around the house. She could hear their footsteps on the gravel outside, and sometimes she saw the flash of a torchlight through a chink in the curtains. Then one by one they came in and were persuaded to take a little nip of whisky. They stood around rather awkwardly with the drinks in their hands, uncomfortable in her presence, trying to say consoling things to her. Sergeant Noonan wandered into the kitchen, came out quickly and said. \"Look, Mrs Maloney. You know that oven of yours is still on, and the meat still inside...I better turn it off for you, hadn't I?\" \"Will you do that, Jack. Thank you so much.\" When the sergeant returned the second time, she looked at him with her large, dark, tearful eyes. \"Would you do me a small favour--you and these others?\" She said. \"We can try, Mrs Maloney.\" \"Well,\" she said. \"You must be terribly hungry by now because it's long past your supper time. Why don't you eat up that lamb that's in the oven? It'll be cooked just right by now.\" \"Wouldn't dream of it,\" Sergeant Noonan said. \"Please,\" she begged. \"Please eat it.\" The four policemen _ , but they were clearly hungry, and in the end they were persuaded to go into the kitchen and help themselves. The woman stayed where she was, listening to them through the open door, and she could hear them speaking among themselves, their voices thick and sloppy because their mouths were full of meat. \"The guy must've used a big thing to hit Patrick,\" one of them was saying. \"The doctor says his skull was smashed all to pieces.\" \"That's why it ought to be easy to find.\" \"Exactly what I say.\" \"The murderer's not going to carrying a thing like that around with him longer than he needs.\" One of them belched. \"Personally, I think it's right here on the premises.\" \"Probably right under our very noses. What you think, Jack?\" And in the other room, Mary Maloney began to giggle. \n Question: Which of the following is incorrect according to the passage? \n Options: (A) The policemen searched around the house until night. (B) The policemen were dealing with the murder of Mary's brother. (C) The Maloney's didn't have a big spanner. (D) Patrick died because of a critical damage to his head.",

After dark, she goes to a farmhouse where the Man (George O'Brien) and the Wife (Janet Gaynor) live with their child. She whistles from the fence outside. The Man is torn, but finally departs, leaving his wife with the memories of better times when they were deeply in love.The man and woman meet in the moonlight and kiss passionately. She wants him to sell his farm\u00e2\u0080\u0094which has not done well recently\u00e2\u0080\u0094to join her in the city. When she suggests that he solve the problem of his wife by drowning her, he throttles her violently, but even that dissolves in a passionate embrace.

He prepares to throw her overboard, but when she pleads for his mercy, he realizes he cannot do it. He rows frantically for shore, and when the boat reaches land, the Wife flees.She boards a trolley, and he follows, begging her not to be afraid of him. The trolley brings them to the city. Her fear and disappointment are overwhelming. He plies her with flowers and cakes and finally she stops crying and accepts his gifts. Emerging back on the street, they are touched to see a bride enter a church for her processional, and follow her inside to watch the wedding. The Man breaks down and asks her to forgive him. After a tearful reconciliation, they continue their adventure in the city, having their photograph taken together and visiting a funfair. As darkness falls, they board the trolley for home.Soon they are drifting back across the lake under the moonlight. A sudden storm causes their boat to begin sinking. The Man remembers the two bundles of reeds he placed in the boat earlier and ties the bundles around the Wife. The boat capsizes, and the Man awakes on a rocky shore. He gathers the townspeople to search the lake, but all they find is a broken bundle of reeds floating in the water.Convinced the Wife has drowned, the grief-stricken Man stumbles home. The Woman From the City goes to his house, assuming their plan has succeeded. The Man begins to choke her. Then the Maid calls to him that his wife is alive, so he releases the Woman and runs to the Wife, who survived by clinging to one last bundle of reeds.The Man kneels by the Wife's bed as she slowly opens her eyes.

A regional combined score, based on the distribution of percentage neuropil occupied by MAP2 and SYN and emphasizing severity of ND, was created for each brain region: midfrontal cortex, hippocampus, and putamen.', 'The regional combined scores from each brain region studied were better correlated with level of global NP impairment than measures of SYN and MAP2 individually. In a regression, hippocampal and putamen regional combined scores were independent predictors of degree of antemortem NP impairment (F(3,23) = 6.17; P < 0.01; R2 = 0.45).

His crew are casting nets when they witness an American Air Force plane crash into the water, scaring Franco's crewmates off in a rowboat. The simple-mined Franco, who cannot steer the boat, is left stranded. Immediately, the incident alerts the secret services of many nations, as well as Spectralis, an Italian underground spy group headed by Pasqualino aka: Number One. It also attracts the attention of the sinister Dr. Yes (Youssef Wahby), a crazed scientist out to rule the world.When Franco is washed up on an Egyptian beach, he is abducted by a spy called Ciccio, Number 87 (Ciccio Ingrassia), a minor Spectralis agent trying to improve his position in the organization. He has been dispatched to investigate the missing nuclear bomb, and believes that the fisherman has vital information of its whereabouts. At first, Ciccio is unable to extract information from the buffoonish fisherman. His attempt to threaten Franco with torture on a mechanical ass-kicking device backfires (so to speak) when Ciccio lets himself be talked into demonstrating the necessary posture himself.Franco makes his escape and arrives at a local train station. Too dim-witted to understand that he's in Egypt, attempts to purchase a railroad ticket back to his home in Palermo. But the language barrier is an obstacle. However, an Italian priest in line at the window helps him out and Franco treats the man to a cappuccino at the station bar. As Franco explains his predicament in detail to the bewildered padre, his hollering voice attracts the attention of a beautiful woman, named Cinzia (Julie Menard) who joins in the conversation.Back at the Spectrallis base in Egypt, Ciccio is attacked by three persistent but inept spies named James Bomb (Adel Adham), Modesty Bluff (Eugenia Litrel) and Derek Flit (Franco Bonvicini). Fortunately for Ciccio, they are so fixated on depriving each other of the catch then let him escape unnoticed while they brawl it out.Meanwhile, Cinzia has lured Franco back to her hotel room with the promise of an erotic liaison. Unknown to Franco, she is an agent for Dr. Yes. While her back is turned, however, Bomb, Bluff, and Flit break into the room and attempt to abduct Franco, with the same hilarious results as before. Then Ciccio arrives, grabs his prisoner back, and spirits him away to the base. This time Ciccio uses a lie detector to probe Franco's mind by asking him questions about the atomic bomb. Seeing that Franco knows nothing, Ciccio confides in him that his superiors will have him killed for failure to find the missing atomic bomb. Franco talks Ciccio into teaming up in hatching a plot to plant a fake atomic bomb where it can be found.Franco and Ciccio make contact with Cinzia who believes their claims that they have found the missing bomb. She tricks them into a meeting with Dr. Yes at his headquarters beneath a large villa outside Cairo. Franco and Ciccio learn that the so-called mad genius is attempting to revive an Egyptian mummy of Nabuco Sonor, the Queen of the Dead. He requires the atomic bomb to achieve her reanimation. His insane experiments appear to be successful when he achieves a twitch of the thumb from a specimen. Franco and Ciccio deliver the fake bomb, only to be told that they will be sacrificed to the Queen of the Dead on her revival. The duo laugh, knowing that the bomb is not real. But their hilarity turns to terror when the mummy stands up and advances towards them. But Dr. Yes' plans are thwarted when the \"mummy\" is revealed to be Derek Flit in disguise. With the aid of Bomb and Bluff, Flit attack and beats up all of Dr. Yes' men, and then abduct Franco and Ciccio. Back out in the desert, the three spies fall out again over who will get the credit for turning them over to their superiors. Only they stop fighting each other when a live report on their car radio announces that the nations involved have given up the search for America has claimed that there was no nuclear bomb actually on board.Franco takes the disgraced Ciccio aboard his fishing boat still beached on the shore to sail back to Italy. When they pull up the fishing nets to set off, they discover the real atomic bomb which has been in the boats fishing nets this entire time. Several weeks later, Franco and Ciccio are aboard a yacht living in the life of luxury, with the atomic bomb pointed across the sea. Representatives of the worlds nations are offering them untold riches by telephone to avert destruction. The last shot is of Ciccio's fingers stroking the button that could trigger a nuclear catastrophe...",

It is responsible for the management, maintenance, development, and restoration of inland navigable waterways primarily for recreational purposes. Included as inland waterways are the Barrow Navigation, the Erne System, the Grand Canal, the Lower Bann, the Royal Canal, the Shannon\u2013Erne Waterway and the Shannon Navigation. Context_2 : The West Coast Canal or National Waterway No 3 is a 168-km stretch of this inland navigational route located in Kerala, India and runs from Kollam to Kottapuram and was declared a National Waterway in 1993. In addition to the main stretch, Champakara and Udyogmandal canals are navigable and connect the industrial centers of Kochi to Kochi port Inland Waterways Authority of India (IWAI) under the Ministry of Shipping is coordinating the task for developing, monitoring and administering national waterways. It is the first National Waterway in the country with 24-hour navigation facilities along the entire stretch.It has been extended to Kozhikode as per National Waterways Bill, 2015. Context_3 : The Fox\u2013Wisconsin Waterway is a waterway formed by the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers. First used by European settlers in 1673 during the expedition of Marquette & Joliet, it was one of the principal routes used by travelers between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River until the completion of the Illinois and Michigan Canal in 1848 and the arrival of railroads. The western terminus of the Fox\u2013Wisconsin Waterway was at the Mississippi at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. It continued up the Wisconsin River about 116 miles (187 km) until reaching Portage, Wisconsin. There travelers would portage to the Upper Fox River, or eventually, use the Portage Canal. It continued about 160 miles (257 km) down the Fox River, following it through Lake Winnebago and continuing on the Lower Fox over 170 feet (50 m) of falls to the eastern terminus of Green Bay. Context_4 : The Alexandria Canal was a canal in the United States that connected the city of Alexandria to Georgetown in the District of Columbia. Context_5 : Little Lake Butte des Morts is a lake in the US state of Wisconsin, eight miles north of Lake Butte Des Morts. It is part of the Fox\u2013Wisconsin Waterway and receives its inflow from a short segment of the Fox River which drains from the north end of Lake Winnebago around Doty Island. The north end of Little Lake Butte des Morts becomes the section of the Fox River running to Green Bay. The lake is part of the Butte des Morts region in Winnebago County, Wisconsin. The southern half of the lake is located within the cities of Menasha and Neenah. Context_6 : The Canal de la Sambre \u00e0 l'Oise is a canal in northern France. It forms a connection between the canalised river Sambre (Meuse basin) at Landrecies and the Oise (Seine basin) at La F\u00e8re. The canal is 71 km long, and has 38 locks. The junction made at La F\u00e8re is with a branch of the Canal de Saint-Quentin, while the Canal lat\u00e9ral \u00e0 l'Oise is joined 10.5\u00a0km further downstream at Chauny. It was used by the standard Freycinet-gauge \"p\u00e9niches\", 38.50 m long, and 5.05 m in beam, carrying up to 250 tonnes. The canal, also a popular waterway for boats heading south from the Netherlands and Belgium to the central French waterways, had to be closed in 2006 when two aqueducts were found to be in danger of failing. Funding has been put in place by the owner, Voies Navigables de France, and the local authorities, with support from the State, and it is expected to reopen the canal throughout in 2020. Context_7 : The Aqueduct Bridge (also called the Alexandria Aqueduct) was a bridge between Georgetown, Washington, D.C., and Rosslyn, Virginia. It was built to transport cargo-carrying boats on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in Georgetown across the Potomac River to the Alexandria Canal. The same eight piers supported two different bridges: a wooden canal bridge (a wooden roadway bridge was added on top of the canal later) and an iron truss bridge carrying a roadway and an electric trolley line. The bridge was closed in 1923 after the construction of the nearby Key Bridge. The shuttered Aqueduct Bridge was demolished in 1933. Context_8 : This is a list of waterways, defined as navigable rivers, canals, estuaries or firths. In practice, and depending on the language, the term 'waterway' covers maritime or inland transport routes, as suggested by 'way'. Wherever a free-flowing river cannot bear load-carrying vessels, the correct term is 'watercourse', with no connotation of use for transport. To be of practical use, the list distinguishes international maritime waterways (including ship canals), international inland waterways, then inland waterways including canals. For countries that have extensive inland waterway networks, reference is made to specific lists for those countries. Context_9 : The Stecknitz Canal (German: \"Stecknitzfahrt\" ) was an artificial waterway in northern Germany which connected Lauenburg and L\u00fcbeck on the Old Salt Route by linking the tiny rivers Stecknitz (a tributary of the Trave) and Delvenau (a tributary of the Elbe), thus establishing an inland water route across the drainage divide from the North Sea to the Baltic Sea. Built between 1391 and 1398, the Stecknitz Canal was the first European summit-level canal and one of the earliest artificial waterways in Europe. In the 1890s the canal was replaced by an enlarged and straightened waterway called the Elbe\u2013L\u00fcbeck Canal, which includes some of the Stecknitz Canal's watercourse. Context_10 : The Kaukauna Locks Historic District is a lock and dam system in Kaukauna, Wisconsin, United States that carried boat traffic around a rapids of the Fox River starting in the 1850s as part of the Fox\u2013Wisconsin Waterway. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1993 for its significance in engineering and transport. fact_1 : The Fox\u2013Wisconsin Waterway is a waterway formed by the Fox and Wisconsin Rivers.

    "user_prompt": "You will be given a summary of a story. You need to create a question that can be answered from the story. You can create a question about characters, events, facts and beliefs, etc. Your question should be specific, try not to use pronouns instead of full names. As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning.\n The novel opens with the introduction of its title characters. The heroine is \"the superb Virginia St. John,\" a celebrated beauty, famous for being famous. At the age of thirty she is the newlywed wife of an English bishop. The hero (the term has to be applied satirically) is Prof. Paul Darnley, a prominent intellectual:\n\"He had written three volumes on the origin of life, which he had spent seven years in looking for in hay and cheese; he had written five volumes on the entozoa of the pig, and two volumes of lectures, as a corollary to these, on the sublimity of human heroism and the whole duty of man. He was renowned all over Europe and America as a complete embodiment of enlightened modern thinking. He criticised everything; he took nothing on trust, except the unspeakable sublimity of the human race and its august terrestrial destinies.\"\nBoth characters are traveling abroad the steamship Australasian, sailing from Melbourne to London; Virginia is on her way to Chausible Island to meet her new husband, while Paul is journeying home to his elderly wife, whom he has been avoiding for the past eighteen months. (Mrs. Prof. Darnley has an irrational determination to convince her atheist and materialist husband of the existence of Hell.) On the voyage, Paul lectures on his value system, which is essentially Comte's \"Religion of Humanity,\" and manages to convince many passengers and crew of the truth of his outlook (though Virginia does not listen to him).\nAn approaching storm inspires the crew to load the ship's cutter with survival supplies, including tinned meats and cases of champagne. The storm passes, but the ship's boiler suddenly explodes; the Australasian quickly sinks with the loss of almost all on board.\nYet Paul and Virginia manage to reach a nearby island in the cutter. (Shipwreck on a deserted island, as a start for a new and better society, is a staple in the utopian genre   as in the Spensonia books of Thomas Spence, among other possible examples.) Paul finds a deserted house built from wreckage; it is a comfortable and neatly furnished cottage, and the two survivors move in. Virginia is deeply distraught over their recent tragedy   but her state of mind improves when she realizes that the largest trunk in her luggage is on the cutter. The tinned meats and champagne also come in handy.\nTwo other survivors appear: an English clergyman who has been converted to Positivism by Paul, and an elderly woman. The latter soon dies, giving Paul and the clergyman opportunity to debate the meaning of her death from the Positivist viewpoint. Paul keeps himself busy searching for the missing link. Liberated from the trammels of traditional culture and belief, Paul confidently expects instant attainment of the sublime happiness that is the natural state of free human beings.\nThe clergyman proves to be an inconvenient convert, however; he spends his time getting drunk and trying to kiss Virginia, and Paul's intellectual arguments have little influence on him. Physical intimidation is more effective, since the clergyman is both a \"coward\" and a \"weakling.\" When the drunken clergyman falls off a cliff, Paul meditates on the utilitarian aspects of his death. Paul eventually converts Virginia; she gives up her religious faith, and replaces it with a sexual desire for Paul   which the intellectual Paul finds very uncomfortable. In her new commitment to \"glorious truth,\" Virginia snoops through all of Paul's private papers, and discovers his secret: he himself was once a clergyman.\nBy the final chapter of the story, Paul is reduced to baying at the moon. His howls attract the notice of another couple. The woman turns out to be Paul's wife, who has come searching for her errant husband. And the man is Virginia's husband the Bishop. It happens that the island on which Paul and Virginia landed is none other than Chausible Island, her destination, and the cottage they've been occupying was prepared by the Bishop for Virginia. At the end of the book, Paul discovers that his wife has attained her goal, and that he now believes in Hell.",

    "user_prompt": "In this task, you are given a set of context paragraph and some supporting facts to answer a question. Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.\nContext_1 : The National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty (NCADP) is a large organization dedicated to the abolition of the death penalty in the United States. Founded in 1976 (the same year the death penalty was reinstated by the Supreme Court of the United States) by Henry Schwarzschild, the NCADP is the only fully staffed nationwide organization in the United States dedicated to the total abolition of the death penalty in the country. It also provides extensive information regarding imminent and past executions, death penalty defendants, numbers of people executed in the U.S., as well as a detailed breakdown of the current death row population, and a list of which U.S. state and federal jurisdictions use the death penalty. Context_2 : On March 27, 1993, in Mesquite, Texas, convenience store clerk Pete Shrum was shot and killed by two armed robbers. Shrum cooperated with the robbers' demands and made no attempt to fight back against them. Despite his cooperation, the robbers murdered him. The crime was recorded by two security cameras in the store. Footage of the murder was shown on television to help identify the killers. Since then, the footage has been featured in many documentaries relating to crime, making it well known. The murder was described as a rare death penalty case, and was the first of only two death penalty cases expected to be tried in Dallas County in 1993. Both suspects were spared the death penalty but were convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the murder. Context_3 : Judy Clare Clarke (born 1952) is an American criminal defense attorney who has represented several high-profile defendants. She has negotiated plea agreements that spare her clients the death penalty, as was the case for Eric Rudolph, Ted Kaczynski, and Jared Lee Loughner. In the case of Susan Smith, Clarke argued to the jury that ultimately voted against imposing the death penalty. Context_4 : Arthur L. Aidala (born 1967 in Brooklyn, New York), currently a New York criminal defense lawyer and legal analyst on Fox News Channel where he appears on various day-time and prime-time programs. He was recently a guest lecturer at Harvard University's Law School at the invitation of professor Alan Dershowitz. In 2012, Aidala was selected as one of New York City's top criminal defense attorneys by \"Super Lawyers Magazine\" . Aidala is the grandson of Artie Aidala, renowned New York State Athletic Commission's ring judge inducted into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 2008 . Artie Aidala was one of the three judges that decided the outcome of the 1971 Ali v. Frazier \"Fight of the Century\" boxing match in Madison Square Garden  . He is the son of Louis R. Aidala, former Manhattan Assistant District Attorney and a criminal defense attorney in practice for 50 years. Louis Aidala was a special prosecutor for the Attica prison riots and more recently represented celebrity Jennifer Lopez in New York City  . Context_5 : Vida B. Johnson is an American criminal defense attorney and professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center. Johnson works in the Criminal Defense and Prisoner Advocacy Clinic and Criminal Justice Clinic, and supervises attorneys in the E. Barrett Prettyman Post-Graduate Fellowship Program. Johnson regularly writes in the area of criminal law and procedure. Context_6 : The Catholic Church's position on capital punishment has varied throughout the centuries following the Church's establishment, evolving from somewhat supportive to largely apathetic to mostly anti-capital punishment. In more recent times, the Catholic Church has generally moved away from any explicit condoning or approval of capital punishment and has instead increasingly adopted a more disapproving stance on the issue. Modern Church figures such as Pope John Paul II, Pope Francis, and the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops have in fact actively discouraged the death penalty or advocated for the out-right abolition of the death penalty. Historically, the teaching of the Catholic Church used to categorize capital punishment as a form of \"lawful slaying\", a view defended by theological authorities such as Augustine and Thomas Aquinas. Augustine felt that the death penalty was a means of deterring the wicked and protecting the innocent. In the Middle Ages, Thomas Aquinas reaffirmed this position. (See also Aquinas on the death penalty). However, after the Second Vatican Council the Catholic Church has been staunchly opposed to the death penalty. Context_7 : Daniel \"Dan\" Arshack (born March 30, 1956) is an American criminal defense attorney, co-founder of The Bronx Defenders, managing partner of the law firm Arshack, Hajek and Lehrman, PLLC, and a founding member of the International Criminal Bar, which was created to promote \"the development of an independent legal profession and practice before the International Criminal Court.\" Arshack, who has been a defender for his entire career and \"has never put anyone behind bars as either a prosecutor or government counsel,\" is known for his expertise on international criminal justice issues, lawyer trainings, and anti-death penalty advocacy. Arshack has conducted training for lawyers in Paris, Beirut, the Hague, Victoria, Montreal, Liberia, and New York. His specialties are trial advocacy techniques, ethics, and international criminal tribunals. He has also been an adjunct professor of trial advocacy at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in New York. Context_8 : Cheryl Bormann is an attorney from Chicago. Bormann specializes in the defense of serious criminal charges including murder where the government is seeking the death penalty. She is best known for defending Waleed bin Attash before the Guantanamo military commission which began in 2012. Bormann studied law at Loyola University Chicago. From 2008 through 2011 she headed the Capital Trial Assistance Unit at the Illinois State Appellate Defender, the state agency responsible for providing legal assistance to defendants in death penalty cases in Illinois. The abolition of the death penalty in Illinois in 2011 rendered Bormann's position redundant. Context_9 : Eric Robert Rudolph (born September 19, 1966), also known as the Olympic Park Bomber, is an American domestic terrorist convicted for a series of anti-abortion and anti-gay-motivated bombings across the southern United States between 1996 and 1998, which killed two people and injured over 120 others. Context_10 : Andrea Pia Kennedy Yates (born July 2, 1964) is a former resident of Houston, Texas, who confessed to drowning her five children in their bathtub on June 20, 2001. She had been suffering for some time with very severe postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis. She was represented by Houston criminal defense attorney George Parnham. Chuck Rosenthal, the district attorney in Harris County, asked for the death penalty in her 2002 trial. Her case placed the M'Naghten Rules, along with the Irresistible Impulse Test, a legal test for sanity, under close public scrutiny in the United States. She was convicted of capital murder. After the guilty verdict, but before sentencing, the State abandoned its request for the death penalty in light of false testimony by one of its expert psychiatric witnesses. She was sentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole after 40 years. The verdict was overturned on appeal. fact_1 :  She has negotiated plea agreements that spare her clients the death penalty, as was the case for Eric Rudolph, Ted Kaczynski, and Jared Lee Loughner. fact_2 : Eric Robert Rudolph (born September 19, 1966), also known as the Olympic Park Bomber, is an American domestic terrorist convicted for a series of anti-abortion and anti-gay-motivated bombings across the southern United States between 1996 and 1998, which killed two people and injured over 120 others.

(Anthony Montgomery), Stray Bullet (Rashaan Nall) and Butch (Red Grant) accidentally free a Leprechaun that was imprisoned by record producer Mac Daddy O'Nassas (Ice-T) 20 years earlier. The Leprechaun hunts the friends in order to recover his magic flute, which places listeners of its tune in a euphoric trance. After killing some people, such as a reverend, DJ artists, and a hot girl, the Leprechaun reaches the three friends at Postmaster P.'s home. When the rap artists and the Leprechaun engage in a fight, the Leprechaun kills Stray Bullet by making him shoot himself in the mouth with his own pistol while Postmaster P. and Butch stare in horror. Butch visits Postmaster P. at his grandma's house and convinces him to use a joint laced with four-leaf clovers to strip the Leprechaun of his powers in order to steal back the flute.Postmaster P. and Butch then visit the club in which the Leprechaun has taken up residence. In order to gain entry they dress in drag. Postmaster P then disenchants the Zombie Fly Girls[clarification needed] by having them smoke one of the joints laced with clovers. The duo then goes upstairs to find the Leprechaun who wants the dragged up Postmaster P. to give him a blowjob. Before proceeding any further, the Leprechaun smokes the clover laced joint and passes out. The rap artists take the flute and head downstairs where Mac Daddy shoots Butch, killing him. Postmaster P. retaliates by shooting Mac Daddy three times. No longer under the effects of clover, the Leprechaun comes downstairs and uses magic to pin Postmaster P. against a girder. Postmaster P. then distracts the Leprechaun, allowing the bullet-ridden Mac Daddy to hit the Leprechaun with a wooden chair. Immediately, the Leprechaun uses magic to explode Mac Daddy's torso, but with the last of his strength, Mac Daddy throws the magic amulet in the air.Cut to a dark stage with much fog and a silhouetted Postmaster P. rapping about how he's finally made it.

BRCA1-associated tumors are predominantly basal-like cancers, whereas BRCA2-associated tumors have a predominant luminal-like phenotype. These two molecular signatures reflect in part the two cell types found in the terminal duct lobular unit of the breast. To elucidate novel genes involved in these two spectra of breast tumorigenesis we performed global gene expression analysis on breast tumors from germline BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers.', 'Breast tumor RNAs from 7 BRCA1 and 6 BRCA2 mutation carriers were profiled using UHN human 19K cDNA microarrays. Supervised univariate analyses were conducted to identify genes differentially expressed between BRCA1 and BRCA2-associated tumors. Selected discriminatory genes were validated using real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction in the tumor RNAs, and/or by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or by in situ hybridization (ISH) on tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing an independent set of 58 BRCA1 and 64 BRCA2-associated tumors.', 'Genes more highly expressed in BRCA1-associated tumors included stathmin, osteopontin, TGFbeta2 and Jagged 1 in addition to genes previously identified as characteristic of basal-like breast cancers. BRCA2-associated cancers were characterized by the higher relative expression of FGF1 and FGFR2. FGFR2 protein was also more highly expressed in BRCA2-associated cancers (P = 0.004).\nAnswer: BRCA1-associated tumours demonstrated increased expression of component genes of the Notch and TGFbeta pathways whereas the higher expression of FGFR2 and FGF1 in BRCA2-associated cancers suggests the existence of an autocrine stimulatory loop.",

Study findings are that 42 percent go online mainly to communicate socially, and 72 percent of college students check emails at least once a day, with 66 percent using at least two email addresses. The most popular online social activity is forwarding messages to friends or family, with 37 percent of college students saying they do so. The study also looked beyond the Internet surfing habits and into the buying habits of this group, and found them responsible for more than US $ 210 billion in sales last year alone. College students have learned how to spend their money, with 93 percent saying low prices were important when shopping. The study also showed that 65 percent make loan payments; 41 percent of freshmen have a credit card; and 79 percent of seniors have a credit card. A significant number of charges on these credit cards are likely to be for entertainment and leisure expenses. \n Question: College students in the US, as this passage shows,  _  . \n Options: (A) waste much time visiting the Internet (B) lead an exciting life by using the Internet (C) don't have to learn their lessons in their classrooms (D) spend too much time, in the opinion of the writer, visiting the Internet",

Jerry Sunborne (Benicio del Toro) is a heroin addict who has been Brians close friend since childhood.Audrey gets tragic news delivered to her door by the local police: Brian has been killed in an attempt to defend a woman who was being beaten by her husband. On the day of the funeral Audrey realises that she has forgotten to inform Jerry of Brian's death. Her brother Neal (Omar Benson Miller) delivers the message to Jerry and takes him to the funeral.Audrey invites Jerry to move into the room adjacent to their garage, which he does. During his stay at the Burke home Jerry struggles to remain drug-free and also becomes very fond of Harper and Dory. The relationship between Jerry and Audrey is fragile and complicated. Jerry helps Audrey cope in many ways, including lying with her in bed to help her sleep. But Audrey, upset and confused, takes out her grief at Brian's death on Jerry. She becomes angry when Jerry helps Dory overcome his fear of submerging his head in the pool, as this had been something Brian had tried to do for years. Eventually her rudeness to him causes Jerry to move out and relapse with heroin. Audrey and Neal rescue and rehabilitate him and he agrees to admit himself to a specialized clinic. At first Harper, who has come to love Jerry, is angry that he is leaving, but after he leaves her a heartfelt note she forgives him. At the close of the film Jerry is still struggling with his addiction but seems to be well on his way to recovery. He leaves flowers on Audrey's doorstep with a note that reads, \"Accept the good.\"(Source: WikiPedia. Bangs_McCoy)",

June 9, 2016 -- the day that Donald Trump Jr., Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort met with a Russian lawyer to get opposition research on Hillary Clinton -- was a 24-hour period that the businessman-turned-presidential candidate likely hated: The spotlight wasn't on him. But more than a year after that unseasonably cool Thursday in New York, what happened on June 9 has intensified the spotlight on Trump -- now president -- and his family. News of the meeting between Natalia Veselnitskaya, billed in an email as a \"Russian government attorney\" and three of Trump's top campaign aides has rocked the Trump White House and led Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Sen. Tim Kaine, to speculate whether Trump Jr.'s behavior amounts to treason.June marked the unofficial start of the general electionThe meeting was scheduled for 4:00 p.m. in Donald Trump Jr.'s office \n Question:_, in her most retweeted tweet of the entire campaign, responded to Trump: \"Delete your account,\" she wrote.",

His accomplices are race track cashier George Peatty (Elisha Cook, Jr.); the barman Mike O'Reilly (Joe Sawyer), crooked policeman Randy Kenna (Ted de Corsia), and former alcoholic Marvin Unger (Jay C. Filppen) who finances the operation. Johnny's fiancee, Fay (Colleen Gray), worries that he may go back to prison for this but he tells her that the risks are worth taking.George needs the money to give to his nagging and narcissistic wife Sherry (Marie Windsor), who is having an affair with mobster Val Cannon (Vince Edwards), whom is trying to persuade Sherry to let him kill George so they can run off with his money. Mike needs the money to care for his constantly sick wife. Randy is revealed to need the money to pay off some local bookies for bad gambling debts.During their meeting to discuss the details of the robbery, George catches Sherry spying on them and subdues her. He sends the others, including George, home to talk with her. Johnny knows that Sherry is a grifter only out for money, and he tells her that he will give her a generous share of their loot when it gets pulled off. But Sherry, being who she is, tells Val who agrees to steal the money afterwards so they can have it all for themselves.Johnny hires Nikki Arane (Timothy Carey), a gunman-for-hire and Maurice Oboukhoff (Kola Kwarain), a former ex-con and Russian wrestler, to create diversions at the start of the 7th race when the hold-up will begin.Here is how the heist is executed in detail from different points of view:At the start of the 7th race, Maurice starts a brawl at Mike's bar. The racetrack guards subdue him. While they are occupied, George opens the door to the payroll office and Johnny slips through. Johnny gets out a rapid-firing shotgun that Mike planted earlier in his locker, puts on a mask and holds up the four clerks at the payroll office. Johnny stuffs $2 million in cash into a large bag and throws it out the window. Randy, waiting below, takes the bag, drives to a motel, and leaves it in a room that Johnny is renting. Johnny then escapes from the racetrack in the confusion and panic caused when Nikki shoots the racehorse, Red Lighting, with a high-powered rifle from a distant parking lot. But Nikki is killed by a black policeman (James Edwards), whom he had earlier insulted by calling him a \"nigger\", shoots him down as he attempts to flee out of the parking lot.Afterward, George, Mike, Randy and Marvin wait at Johnny's apartment for him to show up with the loot when they are surprised by Val Cannon and an accomplice of his demanding to know where the loot is. A gunfight ensues and everyone is killed, except George who, though mortally wounded, drags himself home and kills Sherry who admits that she betrayed him, before expiring himself.When Johnny learns that his partners are in trouble, he stuffs the racetrack loot in an old suitcase and goes to the airport and meets with Fay so they can leave town. They both purchase tickets to Boston, but the airport officials refuse to let Johnny carry the large suitcase on the plane, and he reluctantly checks the suitcase in for luggage.On the airport runway, the suitcase containing the money falls off a luggage truck which swerves to avoid hitting a snobbish, rich woman's pet dog. The suitcase breaks open, and the money is scattered in all directions. Johnny and Fay attempt to escape from the airport, but they cannot hail a taxi. \"What's the difference?\", Johnny says as the police close in on them.",

During the 16th and 17th centuries, the plague was present in Paris around 30 per cent of the time. The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 and 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdams population died in 1623\u20131625, and again in 1635\u20131636, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576\u20131577 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629\u20131631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679.

They are trying to sell it to the Pirate King (George Cooper, sung Ian Samwell). At a military parade (\"Entrance of the Peers\"), Dick sees the Sorcerer speaking with the Pirate King. There, Nanki (John Newton, sung Casey Kelly) sees his evil twin brother Poo (same), who is picking pockets. Dick goes for backup to headquarters, the Hexagon (\"Here's a how-dee-do\"), finding the Captain (Peter Reeves) and the Major-General (Francis Ghent, sung John Baldry; \"I am the very model of a modern major general\").Dick then goes to the pirates' lair, \"The Queen's Nose\" (\"Oh, better far to live and die\"). There, Rose Maybud (Julia McKenzie, sung Liza Strike), the barmaid, wants to find \"a man of pure evil\", so she can reform him. She and Dick have a moment (\"Prithee, pretty maiden\"), but she loses interest, since he is good. The Sorcerer and his sidekick arrive (\"My name is John Wellington Wells\"). The Pirate King finalizes the deal to buy the Secret for a modest sum of pirate booty, and the Sorcerer goes to get it, followed by Dick.Dick arrives at the Sorcerer's shop and asks for a potion to make him handsome (\"Sprites of earth and air\") and makes a grab for the Secret, but it falls through the window into the basket of Little Buttercup (Miriam Karlin), a buxom seller of ribbons, laces and marine supplies. Poo steals the basket, and everyone chases him, including three policemen (\"A policeman's lot is not a happy one\"), but they mistake Nanki for Poo and arrest him. The Judge at his trial (Barry Cryer, \"All hail great Judge\"; \"Now, Jurymen, hear my advice\") flirts with Little Buttercup (\"I'm called Little Buttercup\"), ignores Nanki's evidence (\"A wandering minstrel I\" and \"I swear to tell the truth\" based on \"When I go out of door\"), sentences Nanki to 200 years in the Tower of London (\"A Judge is he, and a good judge too\") and leaves with Little Buttercup.At the Tower, Nanki muses on his lot and lost love (\"Farewell my love\"). The spirit of Yum-Yum (Linda Lewis, sung Beth Porter) is trapped in Nanki's shamisen (\"Just as the moon must have the sun\", based on \"The sun whose rays\") and needs Nanki \"to make me a whole woman\". Poo is willing to return the Secret to the Sorcerer in exchange for learning his tricks, but the pirates drag them to \"The Queen's Neck\". The Secret in code, and the Sorcerer must decipher it. Since Poo is \"the most evil man in the world\", Rose decides her love for him and intends to reform him. Meanwhile, at the Hexagon, Dick sees the Rear-Admiral (Francis Ghent, sung John Baldry; \"I am the monarch of the sea\") and his sisters and his cousins and his aunts. He gives the Captain (\"He remains an Englishman\") command of the 'Pinafore' and allows Dick to recruit a crew from the prisoners, and at the Tower, Nanki sings for the prisoners (\"The flowers that bloom in the spring\": Prisoner sung by Ian Samwell), who nearly all enlist.The Sorcerer and Poo are on the pirate ship (\"Pour, oh pour the pirate sherry\"). Rose Maybud, disguised as a pirate, sneaks aboard. Meanwhile, the Captain, accompanied by the Judge, Major-General, Rear-Admiral takes command of the 'Pinafore' (\"When I was a lad\"; \"We sail the ocean blue\"; and \"I am the Captain of the Pinafore\"). They pursue the pirate ship, assisted by two giant cherubs (\"Go, ye heroes\"); meanwhile Poo overfeeds the Sorcerer who gets seasick and hands over the Secret. When the two crews meet, they greet each other warmly. The Pirate King fights the Captain, but the King's trousers fall, and the strawberry birthmark on his backside is seen. Little Buttercup has a secret (\"A many years ago\"); as a wetnurse, she mixed up the infant Pirate King and the Captain (recognizable by the birthmark).Poo sails to the nearby island of Utopia with the Secret, now pursued by everyone (\"With cat-like tread\"). He meets the Regent of Utopia, the Princess Zara (Miriam Karlin) and her court of show-girls. They all sing (\"Hail, hail, and how-dee-do\", based on \"With cat-like tread\"; \"Land of sand and sea and sun\", in the style of The Beach Boys). Zara has Poo arrested. The Sorcerer regains the Secret and is chased by Dick and the Captain. They find that the Secret is in mirror-writing, and decipher it: \"It's love that makes the world go round\" (\"If you go in\"). Nanki and Poo combine into a person composed of both good and evil. The shamisen releases the spirit of Yum Yum (the Queen of Utopia). The Sorcerer falls in love with Little Buttercup, while Rose Maybud and Dick are reunited. Once the Secret is out, war and crime cease around the world (\"Here's a how-dee-do\") and all live happily ever after (\"Entrance of the Peers\", reprise).",

From the vast sum of material Brian had recorded for Smile, only portions of the backing track for \"Heroes and Villains\" (recorded October 1966) and the coda for \"Vegetables\" (recorded April 1967) were used for Smiley Smile. \"Heroes and Villains\" was modified substantially during the Smiley Smile sessions before being issued as a single preceding the album's release. Comparing Brian's original Smile mixes with the single version, Al Jardine called it \"a pale facsimile ... Brian re-invented the song for this record ... He purposefully under-produced the song.\" \"Good Vibrations\", which was recorded sporadically from February to September 1966, appears with no differences from the original single. Brian reportedly objected to the placement of \"Good Vibrations\" on Smiley Smile, but for the first time, he was outvoted by his bandmates, who insisted on its inclusion.\"Wind Chimes\", \"Wonderful\", and most parts of \"Vegetables\" were completely rerecorded with dramatically scaled-down arrangements. \"Vegetables\" was reworked as a kind of campfire song,  \"Wonderful\" traded its harpsichord, strings, and horns with a haphazardly-played organ, high-pitched backing vocals, and a doo-wop sing-along section, and the marimbas in \"Wind Chimes\" were replaced by organ and dissonant noise. Other tracks took elements of Smile era compositions to make something slightly different; \"She's Goin' Bald\" borrows the verse melody from a Smile fragment known as \"He Gives Speeches\", \"With Me Tonight\" is a variation on  \"Vegetables\", and \"Fall Breaks and Back to Winter (W. Woodpecker Symphony)\" lifts a recurring melodic hook from \"Fire\". David Anderle thought that \"what Brian tried to do with Smiley Smile is he tried to salvage as much of Smile as he could and at the same time immediately go into his [long-discussed] humor album.\" Jardine felt that \"there are some pretty cool songs on that album but I didn't like rehashing some of the Smile songs. That didn't work for me.\"Smiley Smile was produced without any direct involvement from Van Dyke Parks. The only songs that appeared to have no connection to the original Smile album were \"Little Pad\" and \"Gettin' Hungry\". In addition, while the Beatles' Paul McCartney was present at an April 1967 session for \"Vegetables\", the recording where he allegedly provides celery biting sounds was not used on Smiley Smile.",

Jack becomes alarmed by a trail of footprints in the snow and pulls Ingrid towards shelter. Sniper gunshots ring out. Ingrid sees Jack pull a gun from his pocket and shoot the approaching sniper. Knowing his identity is in jeopardy, and with little hesitation, Jack shoots and kills Ingrid. He flees to Rome and contacts his handler Pavel (Johan Leysen), who insists that Jack cannot stay in Rome. Pavel sends him to Castelvecchio (a small town in the mountains of Abruzzo). Jack becomes nervous, and, disposing of the cell phone Pavel gave him, goes to nearby Castel del Monte, Abruzzo, instead.\nWhile in Abruzzo, Jack contacts Pavel, who sets him up with another job. He meets Mathilde (Thekla Reuten), who wants him to build a custom sniper rifle for an assassination. He also begins patronizing a prostitute, Clara (Violante Placido), and they begin a relationship separate from her business duties. Jack meets with Mathilde to test the weapon. She is impressed by the craftsmanship, but asks him to make a few more adjustments. Later, Jack realizes that he is being followed by an assassin from Sweden, whom he kills.\nJack is tormented by dreams of the events in Sweden and regrets killing Ingrid. His friendship and conversations with a local priest, Father Benedetto (Paolo Bonacelli), encourage him to question his life choices. Both Mathilde and Clara notice Jack's association with butterflies, Mathilde by his expertise in endangered butterflies and Clara by his prominent tattoo. When Father Benedetto tells Jack he senses he lives in a special kind of hell, \"a place without love,\" Jack starts to let himself feel love for Clara, and envisions a life with her.\nJack talks to Pavel one last time asking how the Swedes have found him. In his growing fear, he even suspects Clara when he discovers a small pistol in her purse. He questions Clara about the gun and is satisfied with her explanation (to defend herself, since there have been newspaper reports of murdered prostitutes).\nJack agrees to deliver the weapon to Mathilde as his last job but at the last moment he opens the briefcase and sabotages the rifle. At the drop-off, Jack becomes suspicious that Mathilde plans to kill him. Before anything can happen, a busload of school children arrives. Mathilde gives Jack his payment a thick envelope full of cash and the two separate. As Mathilde drives away, Pavel contacts her and asks if she has killed Jack. She tells him she has not, but says she is following him and will kill him.\nClara meets Jack at a religious procession in town. Jack asks her to go away with him and she agrees. Mathilde tries to shoot Jack from a nearby rooftop, but the sabotaged rifle explodes in her face. Seeing Mathilde fall from the roof, Jack gives Clara the envelope full of cash and tells her to go to a river where they had picnicked and wait for him. He runs to Mathilde, who is dying on the pavement, and discovers that she also works for Pavel.\nAs Jack goes to meet Clara, he hears Pavel behind him. They exchange gunfire and Pavel drops dead. As Jack drives to meet Clara at the river, he feels his abdomen and realizes he has been shot. Jack arrives at the picnic spot and as he sees Clara, he collapses. Clara screams and runs to the car.

One day at his high school named after Cesar Chavez, Marcus is accused of hacking into the school by vice principal Frederick Benson. Marcus and Benson do not get along and Marcus believes that Benson is perpetually trying to get rid of him. Marcus is let go due to a lack of evidence and he returns to class.\nLater that day, Marcus and his best friend Darryl escape school to play a massive augmented reality role game that partially involves a scavenger hunt around town. They meet up with fellow group members and game players Vanessa and Jolu. While searching for a part for the game, a series of explosions go off in the city. This sets off sirens and alarms which sends everybody running for the shelters. The group initially tries to go to the shelter but then they decide to leave. While leaving, Darryl is stabbed in the crowd. They finally escape the crowd and flag down a vehicle because Darryl needs immediate medical attention. Three men get out of the vehicle and put bags over each group members' head and then shove them into the vehicle.\nMarcus and his friends arrive at an unknown location and are put into a trailer where they are separated and are amongst many other people. They find out that they are being held by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to be interrogated for suspicions of being connected to the terrorist attack. After a series of interrogations that take place over a period of six days, Marcus, Jolu, and Vanessa are finally released. Darryl's whereabouts are unknown. The DHS tells Marcus that they will be monitoring his actions and moves because he is still a suspect. Marcus is \"infuriated at how his civil rights [are] ignored.\"\nMarcus revolts by setting up technological attacks on the DHS in order \"to [thwart] further efforts to restrict personal liberty\". Marcus also sets up a network primarily composed of teenage members using a game console so they can communicate freely while fighting \"the surveillance state.\" This causes a war between the rebelling youth and the Department of Homeland Security.\nWhen a former prisoner who was held by the DHS tells Marcus that Darryl is still alive, Marcus tells a reporter and his family about his actions taken against the DHS. The report from the reporter is then published and the DHS takes Marcus into custody again.

However, inflammatory response leading to graft failure and incomplete in vitro repopulation with recipient cells remain challenging. Shock waves (SWs) were shown to modulate inflammation and to enhance re-epithelialization. We therefore aimed to investigate whether SWs could serve as a feasible adjunct to tissue engineering.', 'Porcine aortic pieces were decellularized using sodium deoxycholate and sodium dodecylsulphate and implanted subcutaneously into C57BL/6 mice (n = 6 per group). The treatment (shock wave therapy, SWT) group received SWs (0.1 mJ/mm(2), 500 impulses, 5 Hz) for modulation of inflammatory response directly after implantation; control animals remained untreated (CTR). Grafts were harvested 72 h and 3 weeks after implantation and analysed for inflammatory cytokines, macrophage infiltration and polarization, osteoclastic activity and calcification. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was performed. Endothelial cells (ECs) were treated with SWs and analysed for macrophage regulatory cytokines. In an ex vivo experimental set-up, decellularized porcine aortic valve conduits were reseeded with ECs with and without SWT (0.1 mJ/mm(2), 300 impulses, 3 Hz), fibroblasts as well as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (all human) and tested in a pulsatile flow perfusion system for cell coverage.', 'Treated ECs showed an increase of macrophage migration inhibitory factor and macrophage inflammatory protein 1\u03b2, whereas CD40 ligand and complement component C5/C5a were decreased. Subcutaneously implanted grafts showed increased mRNA levels of tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin 6 in the treatment group. Enhanced repopulation with recipient cells could be observed after SWT. Augmented macrophage infiltration and increased polarization towards M2 macrophages was observed in treated animals. Enhanced recruitment of osteoclastic cells in proximity to calcified tissue was found after SWT. Consequently, SWT resulted in decreased areas of calcification in treated animals. The reseeding experiment revealed that fibroblasts showed the best coverage compared with other cell types. Moreover, SW-treated ECs exhibited enhanced repopulation compared with untreated controls.\nAnswer: SWs reduce the calcification of subcutaneously implanted decellularized xenografts via the modulation of the acute macrophage-mediated inflammatory response and improves the in vitro repopulation of decellularized grafts. It may therefore serve as a feasible adjunct to heart valve tissue engineering.",

His son, Edward VI, granted it to the John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford, in 1552. The Russell family, who in 1694 were advanced in their peerage from Earl to Duke of Bedford, held the land until 1918.Russell built Bedford House and garden on part of the land, with an entrance on the Strand, the large garden stretching back along the south side of the old walled-off convent garden. In 1630, 4th Earl of Bedford, Francis Russell commissioned Inigo Jones to design and build a church and three terraces of fine houses around a large square or piazza. This had been prompted by Charles I taking offence at the condition of the road and houses along Long Acre, which were the responsibility of Russell and Henry Carey, 2nd Earl of Monmouth. Russell and Carey complained that under the 1625 Proclamation concerning Buildings, which restricted building in and around London, they could not build new houses. For a fee of \u00a32,000, the King then granted Russell a licence to build as many new houses on his land as he \"shall thinke fitt and convenient\".\nThe houses initially attracted the wealthy, though they moved out when a market developed on the south side of the square around 1654, and coffee houses, taverns, and prostitutes moved in. The Bedford Estate was expanded in 1669 to include Bloomsbury, when Lord Russell married Lady Rachel Vaughan, one of the daughters of the 4th Earl of Southampton.By the 18th century, Covent Garden had become a well-known red-light district, attracting notable prostitutes such as Betty Careless and Jane Douglas. Descriptions of the prostitutes and where to find them were provided by Harris's List of Covent Garden Ladies, the \"essential guide and accessory for any serious gentleman of pleasure\". In 1830 a market hall was built to provide a more permanent trading centre. In 1913, Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford, agreed to sell the Covent Garden Estate for \u00a32 million to the MP and land speculator Harry Mallaby-Deeley, who sold his option in 1918 to the Beecham family for \u00a3250,000.",

Along with Captain Freycinet (Claude Rains), he watches as French bomber crews prepare for a raid. Manning's interest focuses on Jean Matrac (Humphrey Bogart), a gunner, and Freycinet describes Matrac's story:Two years earlier, just before the defeat of France by the Germans, five convicts who escaped from Devil's Island are found adrift in a small canoe in the Caribbean Sea by the tramp steamer Ville de Nancy. These five men, Marius (Peter Lorre), Garou (Helmut Dantine), Petit (George Tobias), Renault (Philip Dorn), and their leader, Matrac, are rescued and taken aboard the French freighter commanded by Captain Malo (Victor Francen). Later, when confronted by Captain Freycinet, the five confess to being escaped convicts from the French prison colony at Cayenne in French Guiana. They had been recruited by Grandp\u00c3\u00a8re (Vladimir Sokoloff), a fervently patriotic ex-convict, to fight for France in her hour of need. To Grandp\u00c3\u00a9re, the inmates had recounted Matrac's troubles in pre-war France to convince the old man to choose Matrac to lead the escape. A crusading newspaper publisher, Matrac, being opposed to the Munich Pact, had been framed for murder to shut him up.By the time the Ville de Nancy nears the port of Marseille, France has surrendered to Nazi Germany, and a collaborationist Vichy government has been set up. Upon hearing the news, the captain secretly decides not to deliver his valuable cargo to the Germans. Pro-Vichy passenger Major Duval (Sydney Greenstreet) organizes an attempt to seize control of the ship, but is defeated, in great part due to the escapees. When they reach England, the convicts join the Free French bomber squadron.As Freycinet finishes his tale, the squadron returns from its mission over France. Renault's bomber is delayed, as Matrac is allowed to drop a letter over his family's house before returning from each mission. His wife Paula (Mich\u00c3\u00a8le Morgan) and their son, whom he has never seen, live in occupied France. Renault's bomber finally lands. It has been badly shot up, and Matrac has been killed. After the squadron bury him, Freycinet reads Matrac's letter to his son that had been unable to be delivered.",

Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning.\n In 2017, widespread use of remotely controlled androids called \"surrogates\" allows everyone to live in idealized forms from the safety of their homes. In contrast to their surrogates, the human operators are depicted as slovenly and homebound. A surrogate's operator is protected from harm and feels no pain when the surrogate is damaged. FBI agent Tom Greer (Bruce Willis) has a strained relationship with his wife Maggie (Rosamund Pike), as a result of their son's death several years before. He never sees her outside of her surrogate and she criticizes his desire to interact via their real bodies.\nTom and his partner, Agent Jennifer Peters (Radha Mitchell), investigate the death of two people who were killed when their surrogates were destroyed at a club. Jarid Canter (Shane Dzicek), one of the victims, is the son of Dr. Lionel Canter (James Cromwell), the inventor of surrogates. Tom and Jennifer determine that a human named Miles Strickland (Jack Noseworthy) used a new type of weapon to overload the surrogates' systems and kill their operators. After locating Strickland, Tom attempts to bring him into custody. Strickland uses the weapon and injures Tom during the chase; Tom inadvertently crash-lands into an anti-surrogate zone known as the Dread Reservation (one of many throughout the United States). A mob of humans eventually destroys Tom's surrogate, forcing him to interact in the world without one. The Dread leader known as The Prophet (Ving Rhames) kills Strickland and confiscates the weapon.\nTom learns from Colonel Brendan (Michael Cudlitz) that the same company manufacturing the surrogates originally produced the weapon under a government contract. It was designed to load a virus that overloads the surrogate's systems, thus disabling it. Unexpectedly, the weapon also disabled the fail-safe protocols protecting surrogate operators. After the first test, the project was scrapped and all but one prototype were destroyed.\nJennifer is murdered and an unknown party hijacks her surrogate. Tom is informed that Andrew Stone (Boris Kodjoe), his FBI superior, supplied the weapon to Strickland and ordered Dr. Canter's assassination for his criticism of surrogate use. Jarid, using one of his father's many surrogates, was killed instead. The Prophet orders the weapon be delivered to Jennifer. During a military raid on the reservation led by Col. Brendan, the Prophet is shot, revealing his identity as a surrogate, with none other than Dr. Canter himself as the operator.\nTom goes to Dr. Canter's home and discovers that he has been controlling not only the Prophet, but Jennifer as well. Using Jennifer's surrogate in FBI Headquarters, Dr. Canter uses the weapon to kill Stone and proceeds to upload the virus to all surrogates, which will destroy the surrogates and kill their operators. Believing his plan to be unstoppable, Canter disconnects from Jennifer's surrogate and swallows a cyanide pill. Tom takes control of Jennifer's surrogate and, with the assistance of the network's system administrator, Bobby Saunders (Devin Ratray), insulates the virus so the operators will survive. Tom can choose to either destroy all surrogates or simply cancel the virus upload. Tom ultimately decides to let the virus permanently shut down surrogates worldwide. People emerge from their homes without their surrogates, confused and afraid.\nTom returns home and shares an emotional embrace with Maggie in her real form. The film ends with an aerial view of the collapsed surrogates along with overlapping news reports of downed surrogates all over the world and how people are now \"on their own\" again.",

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article.\nArticle: Scientists know of more than 1,000 volcanoes on the surface of Venus, Earth's \"sister\" planet. A big question has been: Are they still active? The scientists say yes. Their evidence for recent volcanic activity on Venus comes from a lava  flow in the planet's northern hemisphere. The flow is hotter than the rocks around, which means the lava might still be cooling off. \"The flow we studied seems to be very young---it is still warm inside,\" Nataliya Bondarenko said. Venus is a difficult planet to study from Earth because it is surrounded by thick clouds. Telescopes on Earth can't see through these clouds, so the best information about Venus comes from spacecraft orbiting it. Bondarenko and her colleagues studied the lava flow using data from NASA's Magellan mission. That spacecraft spent four years in orbit around Venus and used radar to make a map of 98 percent of the planet's surface. On October 11th, 1994, the mission ended, and the spacecraft plunged   through Venus' heavy cloud cover and crashed onto the planet below. While in orbit, the Magellan craft sent microwaves, which can go through Venus' clouds, to the surface. Microwaves are invisible and can be as long as three feet. These waves are a kind of energy, like light. And like light, they bounce off surfaces. The way the waves bounced off the Venus' surface and back to the craft supplied information that the scientists used to estimate the temperature of various parts of the planet's surface. Bondarenko's team found that the lava flow was hotter than its surroundings---which may mean the lava flow is in the process of cooling. The scientists say the lava flow can't be very old because if it were, it would have cooled off enough that Magellan wouldn't have noticed the difference in microwaves. She adds that the flow appears in a 1978 view of the surface that a craft called the Pioneer Venus Orbiter captured. \n Answer: It fell onto Venus.",

He had snuck out of the small Terran base on the planet Warlock in the Circe system to find two artificially evolved wolverines, Taggi and his mate Togi, and bring them back to the base before anyone notices that they are missing. While he is gone a force of Throgs, implacably hostile insectoid aliens, attacks the base and kills all of its occupants. Shann moves across country with the wolverines and sees a downed scoutship explode and destroy a Throg flying disc.\nA wounded Throg confronts Shann, but a well-aimed rock kills it. Shann s rescuer is Ragnar Thorvald, who survived the crash of the scoutship and turned it into a booby trap. Together the two men leave the scene and begin living off the land in a way that implies a native people, not Terrans. Days later they make a night raid on the base, now occupied by Throgs, and they and the wolverines barely escape. On a raft they head for the distant sea, where they expect to find refuge.\nAfter evading a Throg search party, they reach their goal. Thorvald displays a coin-like disc that suddenly turns him into a zombie. Shann knocks the disc away and Thorvald comes back to himself. Now he knows whither they should go. The men build an outrigger canoe and they and the wolverines go to an island, where Thorvald strands the other three.\nShann seeks to escape from the island, to return to the mainland with the wolverines. But he finds that he sabotages his own work, apparently under the control of another being. He sets a trap and soon finds a small dragon-like humanoid caught in it. The creature can communicate with him and control him telepathically and she takes him to a cavern to meet three other Warlockians, who want to find out who and what he is.\nIn a fog-filled cavern Shall must confront old memories somehow made physically real as long as he believes in them. He has to remain focused on what is true in order to survive. During the ordeal he reunites with Thorvald, who refers to the natives as Wyverns.

Shann manages to get the Throg out but is captured by the team sent to pick it up. The Throgs take Shann back to the Terran base and compel him to call the colonization ship that is coming, to lure it down so that the Throgs can kill the passengers and crew. Shann manages to warn the ship and to draw a Patrol cruiser to the base, dooming the Throgs. Before the Throgs can begin torturing Shann to death, Thorvald and the Wyverns envelop them in a fog that realizes their worst fears and kills them.\nAfter his wounds have healed Shann discovers that he and Thorvald are to form the core of an embassy established on Warlock to maintain contact with the Wyverns.",

As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning.\n A wealthy young English gentleman, Louis Trevelyan, visits the fictional Mandarin Islands, a distant British possession, and becomes smitten with Emily Rowley, the eldest daughter of the governor, Sir Marmaduke Rowley. The Rowleys accompany Trevelyan to London, where he marries Emily. When the rest of the family goes home, Emily's sister Nora remains behind, under Trevelyan's protection.\nThe marriage is initially a happy one and the couple have a baby boy. Then a seemingly minor matter undermines their marriage. Colonel Osborne, an old friend of Sir Marmaduke's, visits Emily much too frequently for her husband's taste. Though nothing improper occurs, Trevelyan orders his wife to avoid the man in future. Emily resents his lack of trust and makes no attempt to hide it. Their relationship deteriorates to the point that they separate.\nMeanwhile, Nora attracts two admirers, the wealthy Charles Glascock, the eldest son and heir of Lord Peterborough, and Hugh Stanbury, a close friend of Trevelyan's from their days at Oxford University. Stanbury ekes out a precarious living writing newspaper articles. Glascock proposes to Nora, but despite the fact that Stanbury has given no indication of his feelings for her, she rejects the future nobleman, not without a great deal of struggle and much to the dismay of her friends.\nAnother subplot involves Jemima Stanbury, the capricious, formidable spinster aunt of Hugh. In her youth, she had been engaged to the eldest son of a leading banker. They had had a falling out and parted company, but upon his demise, he had left everything to her, making her very wealthy. Aware of the poverty of Hugh's branch of the family, she had generously paid for his education and helped him get a start in life. However, when he chose to work for what she considered to be a radical publication, the staunch Tory withdrew her support. She then offers to accept one of Hugh's sisters as a companion. After some debate, timid, unassertive Dorothy Stanbury is sent.\nTrevelyan arranges to have Emily and Nora live with Hugh's mother and her other daughter, Priscilla. However, Emily obstinately receives a visit from Colonel Osborne, against all advice to the contrary. Trevelyan finds out and becomes further maddened.\nIn the meantime, Aunt Stanbury tries to promote a marriage between her niece Dorothy and a favoured clergyman, Mr Gibson. This causes much resentment with Arabella and Camilla French, two sisters who had considered him a future husband for one of them (though which was still a matter of much debate). However, this plan is derailed.\nAunt Stanbury had always intended to bequeath her wealth back to the Burgess family, rather than to her Stanbury relations. She had chosen as her heir Brooke Burgess, the nephew of her former fianc . When he visits her for the first time as an adult, everyone is charmed by his warm, lively personality, especially Dorothy. When Gibson finally proposes to her, she cannot avoid unfavourably comparing him to Brooke and declines. Her aunt is at first much put out by Dorothy's obstinacy. Eventually however, she places the blame on the clergyman, which results in a serious breach between them.\nThe feud with his former patron leaves Gibson so distracted that he finds himself engaged to a domineering Camilla French. After a while, he comes to regret his choice. Finally, finding Camilla's overpowering personality unbearable, he extricates himself by agreeing to marry the milder Arabella instead. Camilla is driven to extravagant threats and is finally sent to stay with her stern uncle in the period leading up to the wedding.\nThen Aunt Stanbury becomes very ill, resulting in Dorothy and Brooke spending a good deal of time in each other's company. Brooke takes the opportunity to propose to an unsuspecting Dorothy. She however is reluctant to accept, fearing that her aunt will disinherit Brooke. Instead, the old woman blames her niece. They quarrel and Dorothy returns to her mother.\nAunt Stanbury misses Dorothy greatly and makes it known that she would welcome her back, though she still vehemently opposes her marriage to Brooke. Dorothy does come back, and even tries to break off her engagement, but Brooke will not stand for it. In the end, Aunt Stanbury's love for her niece is stronger than her desires and she gives her blessing to their wedding.\nMeanwhile, Trevelyan departs England to escape the shame he feels. During his aimless wanderings, he meets Mr Glascock, who is on his way to Italy to visit his father. They encounter two attractive young American ladies, Caroline and Olivia Spalding. Glascock's father is in such poor health that the son is obliged to remain in the country to await his probable demise. While waiting, he courts and wins Caroline's hand in marriage, despite her misgivings about her reception in English society.\nTrevelyan receives word that Colonel Osborne has dared to visit Emily once again. While Osborne had not been permitted to see Emily, Trevelyan does not believe it and has the boy taken away from his mother by deception; he takes his son back to Italy, where he descends further into madness. Eventually, he is tracked down by his wife and friends. Emily persuades him first to give her their son, then to return with her to England; he dies, however, shortly after their return. In his dying moments, Emily begs Louis to kiss her hand to signify that he does not believe she did anything wrong. Whether or not he does is unclear, but Emily believes \"the verdict of the dying man had been given in her favour.\"",

To be honest, today is also a good time to be a swinger but it just felt more daring then.Joe Sarno offers up a pretty good soft-core film. In fact, just like today, some of the actors are famous hardcore actors. Unlike today, these people were good actors and these films had a plot and character development.It's pretty much what you would expect out of a swinger's movie. Two couples with open relationships re-ignite the wanderlust out of the MILF of one of the women who has come for a visit. Not much more to it.Of course, when the MILF is Jennifer Welles then it is a different story. Not too many 40-somethings look as delicious undressed as Ms. Welles. It's worth the price alone to see Ms. Welles look at herself in the mirror as if she's Aphrodite. She's no \"Stifler's Mom\". She's way sexier.I also digged Chris Jordan's Anna. Jordan looks and sounds so much like Elaine Joyce that I thought she might be her \"separated at birth\" twin or even Elaine herself. Anna is always eating but must have incredible metabolism.Unlike 1990's soft-core porn, 70's softie porn retained the hardcore film's realism (something that 2000's soft-core has brought back on occasion, instead of the 90's music and canned orgasms) and it is here in full force. It's not real but it feels real.For those who enjoyed the Quebec produced \"Deux Femmes En Or\", you'll enjoy this one.

Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning.\n In the summer of 1972, Vada Sultenfuss is an 11-year-old tomboyish girl and a hypochondriac. Harry Sultenfuss, Vada's father, is an awkward widower who does not understand his daughter, so he constantly ignores her. His profession as a funeral director has led his daughter to develop an obsession with death. Vada regularly tends to her grandmother,  Gramoo , who suffers from Alzheimer's disease and whose wandering mind likewise affects Vada. Her Uncle Phil lives near by and frequently stops by to help the family.\nVada hangs out with her best friend Thomas J. Sennett, an unpopular boy her age who is allergic to \"everything.\" However, other girls tease the two, thinking they are more than just friends. Thomas J. often accompanies Vada when she visits the doctor, who assures her that she is not sick and that she has no chicken bone stuck in her throat.\nVada's summer begins well. She befriends Shelly DeVoto, the new makeup artist at her father's funeral parlor, who provides her with guidance. She also develops a crush on her fifth-grade school teacher, Mr. Bixler, and hears about an adult poetry writing class that he is teaching. Vada steals some money from the cookie jar in Shelly's trailer to cover the cost of the class. When advised to write about what is in her soul, Vada fears that she killed her mother, who died two days after giving birth to her. Soon things start to fall apart.\nWhen Harry and Shelly start dating, this affects Vada's attitude towards Shelly. One night, Vada follows Harry and Shelly to a bingo game and brings Thomas J. along to disrupt it. On the Fourth of July, when Shelly's ex-husband Danny arrives, Vada hopes that he is there to take Shelly back, but to no avail. Vada becomes even more shocked when Harry and Shelly announce their engagement at a carnival, which she contemplates into running away with Thomas J.\nVada is starting to see changes within herself, as she is running around screaming that she is hemorrhaging. Shelly politely explains to Vada that her first period is a completely natural process. As Vada realizes this only occurs with girls, she doesn't want to see Thomas J., who happens to come by shortly afterward. A couple of days later though, Vada and Thomas J. are sitting under a tree by the river, where they share an innocent first kiss.\nVada and Thomas J. come across a bee hive hanging from a tree, which Thomas J. decides to knock down. Vada loses her mood ring in the process, so they start looking for it, but the search is cut short as the bees start swarming, making them run away. Thomas J. later returns by himself and finds the ring. Unfortunately, because he kicked the bee hive beforehand, the bees begin to swarm Thomas J. just as he finds the ring, so it is too late for him to escape. Thomas J. dies from the attack, due to being allergic to bee stings.\nHarry is left to deliver the tragic news to Vada, which devastates her so much that she will not even leave her bedroom. When she attends Thomas J.'s funeral, her emotions become so strong that she runs away. Vada hurries to Mr. Bixler's house, wanting to stay with him, and discovers that he is about to get married to someone else. She then runs to her and Thomas J.'s hangout spot near the tree to reflect on what has happened. When Vada returns home, everyone is relieved, including Shelly, whom Vada begins to accept as her future stepmother. Her grief also manages to mend the rift between her and her father. Harry explains to Vada that her mother's death wasn't her fault and things like that can happen without explanation.\nToward the end of summer, Vada and her father see Mrs. Sennett, who still struggles with her son's death. She gives Vada her mood ring back that Thomas J. had found and Vada gives Mrs. Sennett some comfort. On the last day of writing class, Vada reads a poem summoning the loss of her best friend before going out to spend time with her new friend Judy.",

It is a very lucrative business and John Girdlestone and his son Ezra Girdlestone are respected by everyone. Both father and son are cynics and have no other thought but for their business; after giving a donation of  25 for charity, John Girdlestone remarks to himself that it is not a bad \"investment\", as it will make a favorable impression on the collector, who is a Member of Parliament, whose influence he hopes to use some day. Ezra, his son, is even more of a cynic, as the elder Girdlestone's cynicism is mitigated by his supposed religiosity. However, he manifests a great acumen for business, sometimes, even surpassing his father's sharpness in business matters. A series of disastrous speculations by the elder Girdlestone financially ruins the firm. After keeping the impending bankruptcy a secret from everyone for a time, he tells his son (whom he has fooled with a dummy ledger) about it, who is disgusted by his father's rashness.\nThey resort to chicanery to save the firm. They plan to send an agent to the Ural mountains who will claim to have found diamond mines. They speculate that the resulting plunge in the prices of diamonds in England and South Africa will force the dealers to get rid of their diamonds quickly at absurdly cheap rates to avoid total financial ruin, which would eventually fall on them if diamonds from the Urals start pouring in the market. They will then step in and buy as many diamonds as their remaining money would allow them. Once their capital is exhausted, their agent will disappear and the discovery that the Ural diamond mines were a hoax would skyrocket the prices of diamonds once again, leaving them rich men.\nTheir plan works perfectly and the prices go down just as they had expected. Ezra Girdlestone travels to South Africa to buy from the dealers there while John Girdlestone starts buying in London. After they spend all their money on diamonds and get ready to call their agent back from the Urals, their plan collapses with the discovery of bona fide diamond mines in South Africa. As a fellow conspirator tells Ezra in South Africa: \"Russia or no Russia, the prices will not go up!\" He goes back to England and both of them sell their diamonds cheaply, which leaves them in an even more precarious situation than they already were in.\nA very old friend of John Girdlestone had entrusted his daughter to him before dying. She was heir to  40,000 which she would inherit upon coming of age. John Girdlestone persuades his son to seduce the girl and marry her so that they could get their hands on the money. Ezra fails miserably not only because he is totally inept in romance, but because the girl is already in love with another man. Having exhausted all their means, John Girdlestone decides on a sinister plan. His friend's will provides that if the girl dies before coming of age, John Girdlestone becomes the sole heir. He plans to murder the girl. His son does not favour this plan, but his father persuades him, telling him that it will make the firm rich again.",

Although he earns a successful living in his line of work, he is constantly berated by his father, Marty (Ron Rifkin), a New York City federal judge. One night, his old friend Adam (Jamie Kennedy) stops by the casino to play blackjack, bringing a wealthy associate named Greg Weinstein (Nicky Katt) along with him. Although Seth is content with his earnings through the casino, he becomes increasingly unnerved due to Marty's disapproval and the risk factor of having his business shut down along with his arrest. On another night, Greg recruits Seth to join J.T. Marlin, a brokerage firm based somewhere off the Long Island Expressway, \"a good hour away from Wall Street\" as Seth describes it. He is impressed with not only the chance to earn a legal living, but to make millions of dollars.Arriving at J.T. Marlin, Seth attends a group interview and learns from Jim Young (Ben Affleck), one of the co-founders of the firm, what is expected of his work and also how he can become a millionaire. The firm's techniques of selling are through cold calling investors to sell stock, and Seth joins as a stockbroker trainee, having to close 40 accounts and pass a Series 7 Exam in order to begin working independently. He finds success in his new job as he proceeds to do very well in his work, as well as impressing his parents, becoming part of a crowd of successful senior brokers, and embarking on a romance with Abbie Halpert (Nia Long), a secretary and ex-girlfriend of Greg. Seth also experiences trials and tribulations, including altercations and arguments he experiences with Greg and the decision to close down his casino.On the other hand, J.T. Marlin has been under investigation by the FBI, revealing the firm's illegitimacy. The company is a chop stock brokerage firm that runs a \"pump and dump\", using its brokers to create artificial demand in the stock of expired or fake companies. When the firm is done pumping the stock, the investors then have no one to sell their shares to in the market, and the price of the stock plummets. The federal agents decide to pursue Seth, figuring he is a good target due to his intelligence, and his potential of not being too loyal to the firm due to his short tenure.Seth passes his Series 7 Exam and becomes a senior broker. He then contacts Harry Reynard (Taylor Nichols), the purchasing manager of a gourmet foods company, different and less privileged than the other \"whales\" who are common prey for the firm. Although Harry emphasizes that he and his family are being frugal at the moment in order to buy a house, Seth falsely promises a good investment for him that can very well turn out to be highly profitable. After selling him 100 shares at $8. each, Harry calls back to ask why the stock has done so poorly. Seth sells him even more worthless shares, persuading him the outcome will not be consequential. This creates an excruciating financial situation for Harry and his family, causing him to lose the house he had wanted to purchase as well as being abandoned by his family.Unnerved by the decision to scam Harry, Seth comes to terms with knowing that J.T. Marlin isn't as legitimate as it was made out to be before. Marty then disowns him, blasting him for his dishonest work of stealing and destroying other peoples' lives. Despite this, Seth shows up at his father's office and emotionally explains that he shut down his casino and went along with a highly criminal line of work that he thought was legal in order to gain his family's approval. He then requests that his father helps him on an IPO scheme in order to rob the firm of their money and bring them down. Although Marty initially refuses due to the risk of losing his judgeship, he calls Seth the next day, reconciling with him and offering an involvement in the scheme.Seth is eventually arrested by the FBI for the violation of 26 SEC and NASD regulations, and is brought into their custody along with his father, as the bureau had discovered their IPO scheme due to a tape-recorded phone conversation. The FBI offer him federal immunity if he agrees to testify against J.T. Marlin once all the suspects are brought into court, but can also involve Marty due to evidence of their intentions for an illegal activity. Seth asserts that he will testify against the firm and provide strong evidence of their illegal practices only if his father is released. He and the agents come to an agreement on this, with Seth being kept overnight only to return to work the next day and make copies of investment files onto a floppy disk in order to use as evidence. After that, it is implied that he will be free to go as the FBI will proceed to raid the building and prosecute everybody else.Seth returns to work the next day and goes along with the FBI's instruction. Before leaving, Seth attempts to redeem himself for his actions and attempts to get Harry's money back. He lies to Michael Brantley (Tom Everett Scott), the company founder, by explaining that the firm can lose a lot of money by refusing to continue to do business with Harry Reynard, who Seth makes out to be an important and profitable prospect at a make-or-break turning point. Brantley agrees to proceed based on Seth's explanation, offering him shares of the next IPO, however, with a caveat that he cannot sell the shares until the firm has sold off their shares. In order to sell the shares behind Michael's back, Seth needs a ticket sale signed by a senior broker, something that his direct supervisor, Greg, has explicitly said that he would never do.Seth seeks a signing from Chris Varick (Vin Diesel), explaining that he may well \"do one thing right\" in helping a severely hit investor make his money back, now that the firm will be raided and, soon enough, there will be no future in continuing business at J.T. Marlin. Chris reluctantly agrees to do so, and proceeds to escape the building in an attempt to flee federal enforcement. Seth walks out to his car, deciding what to do with his life now that his ties with J.T. Marlin are finished. As he departs in his car, several FBI cars, buses, and tow trucks enter the parking lot, with agents storming out ready to raid the building.",

Stacia (Fairuza Balk), a recently divorced woman, falls in between the battle of wits.After a transport bus breaks down, Wheeler and Walker kill the driver and passengers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 save for Stacia, who left previously. Fascinated, Wheeler and Walker examine each other's victims. Wheeler murders a woman (Laurene Landon) and hangs her body in the truck, and pistol whips and decapitates a man with the sliding door of the luggage compartment. Walker garrotes the bus driver with a dead snake, shoots a passenger, leaves another passenger to die tied by her wrists to a tree and wrapped in barbed wire (whom Wheeler finds alive and taunts), slaughters a punk, and partially skins his girlfriend before killing her.Later, at a roadside motel, the two psychopaths play head games with each other and Stacia, clashing over who will get to kill her. As she is leaving the motel, Wheeler offers her a ride then assaults her while driving, handcuffing her to the car. He finds Walker on the highway, standing in the lane, and brakes to a stop just before hitting him. Walker accepts a ride, and the two bicker and draw their pistols, ready to kill Stacia and each other. Stacia, sitting in the middle, slams on the brakes and sends the two murderers through the windshield onto the road and causes the truck's cab to fall on its side. Stacia unsuccessfully struggles to get Wheeler's gun, while the wounded Wheeler and Walker fight to determine who will kill her as an ambulance siren sounds.In the end, Wheeler and Walker are side by side in the ambulance, still fighting and cursing at one another. Finally, they cease and declare a truce. Walker attempts to strike a deal with Wheeler as he points out how much fun the two of them could have with an ambulance, revealing that he still has his craft knife he used to torture the stoner's girlfriend. However, one of the EMTs rams syringes full of air into their chests, apparently killing them both.

For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'.

The Turks almost captured the Empire's capital of Vienna, but king of Poland John III Sobieski led a Christian alliance that defeated them in the Battle of Vienna, which shook the Ottoman Empire's hegemony in south-eastern Europe. A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , joined by the Venetian Republic and Poland in 1684 and the Tsardom of Russia in 1686. Ottomans suffered two decisive defeats against the Holy Roman Empire: the second Battle of Moh\u00e1cs in 1687 and the Battle of Zenta a decade later, in 1697. On the smaller Polish front, after the battles of 1683 , Sobieski, after his proposal for the League to state a major coordinated offensive, undertook a rather unsuccessful offensive in Moldavia in 1686, with the Ottomans refusing a major engagement and harassing the army. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldavia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories. The last battle of the campaign was the Battle of Podhajce in 1698, where Polish hetman Feliks Kazimierz Potocki defeated the Ottoman incursion into the Commonwealth. The League won the war in 1699 and forced the Ottoman Empire to sign the Treaty of Karlowitz. The Ottomans lost much of their European possessions, with Podolia  returned to Poland.",

The Hopi pueblos located on the remote Hopi Mesas of Arizona did not receive the advanced notice for the beginning of the revolt and followed the schedule for the revolt. On August 10, the Puebloans rose up, stole the Spaniards' horses to prevent them from fleeing, sealed off roads leading to Santa Fe, and pillaged Spanish settlements. A total of 400 people were killed, including men, women, children, and 21 of the 33 Franciscan missionaries in New Mexico. Survivors fled to Santa Fe and Isleta Pueblo, 10 miles south of Albuquerque and one of the Pueblos that did not participate in the rebellion. By August 13, all the Spanish settlements in New Mexico had been destroyed and Santa Fe was besieged. The Puebloans surrounded the city and cut off its water supply. In desperation, on August 21, New Mexico Governor Antonio de Oterm\u00edn, barricaded in the Palace of the Governors, sallied outside the palace with all of his available men and forced the Puebloans to retreat with heavy losses. He then led the Spaniards out of the city and retreated southward along the Rio Grande, headed for El Paso del Norte. The Puebloans shadowed the Spaniards but did not attack. The Spaniards who had taken refuge in Isleta had also retreated southward on August 15, and on September 6 the two groups of survivors, numbering 1,946, met at Socorro. About 500 of the survivors were Indian slaves. They were escorted to El Paso by a Spanish supply train. The Puebloans did not block their passage out of New Mexico.",

Esther loves Judah but is committed to another. Judah's childhood friend, the Roman citizen Messala (Stephen Boyd), is now a tribune. After several years away from Jerusalem, Messala returns as the new commander of the Roman garrison. Messala believes in the glory of Rome and its imperial power, while Judah is devoted to his faith and the freedom of the Jewish people. This difference causes tension between the friends, and results in their split after Messala issues an ultimatum to Judah.Charlton Heston as Judah Ben-HurDuring the parade for the new governor of Judea, Valerius Gratus, loose tiles fall from the roof of Judah's house. Gratus is thrown from his spooked horse and nearly killed. Although Messala knows this was an accident, he condemns Judah to the galleys and imprisons Miriam and Tirzah. By punishing a known friend and prominent citizen, he hopes to intimidate the Jewish populace. Judah swears to take revenge.After three years as a galley slave, Judah is assigned to the flagship of the Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), who has been charged with destroying a fleet of Macedonian pirates. Arrius admires Judah's determination and self-discipline and offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer. Judah declines the offer, declaring that God will aid him in his quest for vengeance. When the Roman fleet encounters the Macedonians, Arrius orders all the rowers except Judah to be chained to their oars. Arrius' galley is rammed and sunk, but Judah unchains the other rowers, and rescues Arrius. In despair, Arrius wrongly believes the battle ended in defeat and attempts to atone in the Roman way by \"falling on his sword\", but Judah stops him. They are rescued, and Arrius is credited with the Roman fleet's victory.Arrius successfully petitions Emperor Tiberius (George Relph) to free Judah, and adopts him as his son. Another year passes. Wealthy again, Judah learns Roman ways and becomes a champion charioteer, but still longs for his family and homeland.Hugh Griffith as Arab Sheik IlderimJudah returns to Judea. Along the way, he meets Balthasar (Finlay Currie) and an Arab, Sheik Ilderim (Hugh Griffith). The sheik has heard of Judah's prowess as a charioteer, and asks him to drive his quadriga in a race before the new Judean governor Pontius Pilate (Frank Thring). Judah declines, even after he learns that Messala will also compete.Judah returns to his home in Jerusalem. He meets Esther, and learns her arranged marriage did not occur and that she is still in love with him. He visits Messala and demands his mother and sister's freedom. The Romans discover that Miriam and Tirzah contracted leprosy in prison, and expel them from the city. The women beg Esther to conceal their condition from Judah so that he may remember them as they were before, so she tells him that they died. It is then that he changes his mind and decides to seek vengeance on Messala by competing against him in the chariot race.During the chariot race, Messala drives a Greek chariot with blades on the hubs to tear apart competing vehicles; he attempts to destroy Judah's chariot but destroys his own instead. Messala is fatally injured, while Judah wins the race. Before dying, Messala tells Judah that \"the race is not over\" and that he can find his family \"in the Valley of the Lepers, if you can recognize them.\" Judah visits the nearby leper colony, where (hidden from their view) he sees his mother and sister.Blaming Roman rule for his family's fate, Judah rejects his patrimony and Roman citizenship. Learning that Tirzah is dying, Judah and Esther take her and Miriam to see Jesus Christ (Claude Heater), but the trial of Jesus before Pontius Pilate has begun. Judah witnesses the crucifixion of Jesus, and Miriam and Tirzah are miraculously healed during the rainstorm following the crucifixion. Judah declares, \"And I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.\"",

A simple rule of thumb to decide whether a question is a factoid or not is to see if two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage.\nThe plot begins with the portrayal of the Massacre of the Innocents in the Nativity. The remainder of the movie portrays the annunciation (conception) and birth of Jesus Christ to explain why King Herod the Great (Ciar\u00c3\u00a1n Hinds) ordered the murder.The film then goes back one year before the massacre, to Jerusalem where Zachariah is a rabbi and making an offering, when he gets told by the Archangel Gabriel that his wife will bear a son by a vision. He states that he is too old, and is told by Gabriel that he will be unable to speak until the boy is born. It then goes to the town of Nazareth, where a teenaged girl named Mary (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is farming, and soldiers come to collect taxes, one man, who is unable to pay, has a third of his land seized and his daughter pressed into debt slavery to pay his debt. Mary is then, betrothed to marry Joseph of Judaea (Oscar Isaac), is visited by the Angel Gabriel and told that she will become pregnant with God's son, whom she is to name \"Jesus\". He then tells that her God has blessed her cousin Elizabeth (Shohreh Aghdashloo) with a child despite her old age. Mary asks her parents and Joseph could she visit with Elizabeth before the harvest, where she witnesses the birth of John the Baptist to Elizabeth and her husband the priest Zachariah (Stanley Townsend), who regains his speech after he refused to believe the Angel Gabriel's news that he would have a son. Mary returns from the visit pregnant, to the shock of Joseph and her parents, who fear that Joseph will accuse her of fornication, a sin punishable with death by stoning according to the Mosaic Law. At first Joseph does not believe Mary's explanation that she was visited by the angel Gabriel, but decides not to accuse her. Although he is still shocked and angry, Joseph is later visited in a dream by the Angel Gabriel, who tells him of God's plan for Mary's son. Joseph then believes Mary, and is ashamed for his earlier doubts.Meanwhile, Caesar Augustus, the Roman emperor, has demanded that every man and his family across the Roman Empire must return to his place of birth for the census. As a direct descendant of King David, Joseph is forced to travel 110 kilometers (68\u00c2\u00a0mi) across Palestine's rocky terrain from Nazareth to Bethlehem, the place of his birth. With Mary on a donkey laden with supplies, the couple took nearly four weeks to reach Bethlehem. Upon arriving in town, Mary goes into labour, and Joseph frantically seeks a place for her to deliver. There is, however, no room in any inn or home partly because of the census, but at the last minute an innkeeper offers his stable for shelter.Meanwhile, three Magi named Gaspar, Melchior and Balthasar, travel towards Judaea after having previously discovered that three planets will align to form a great star. This Star of Bethlehem appears before the Magi, after a visit by the Angel Gabriel. The Magi visit King Herod the Great and reveal to him that the Messiah is still a child and he will be a Messiah 'for the lowest of men to the highest of kings'. Shocked by this, Herod asks that they visit the newborn Messiah and report the child's location back to him, under the pretence that he, too, would like to worship him (what the Magi did not know was that Herod wanted to kill the baby for fear of a new king taking his throne). Later, the Magi arrive at the stable in which Mary is giving birth to Jesus, and they present the Infant with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.After having been warned by the Angel in a dream, the Magi avoid Herod, but return to their home via a different route. King Herod realises that the Magi have tricked him, and carries out his plan of killing every boy in Bethlehem under the age of two. Joseph is warned in a dream of the danger and flees to Egypt with Mary and Jesus until Herod the Great dies and his two remaining sons (Herod was so paranoid that he killed his own wives, sons, and daughters) named Archelaus and Antipas take over his kingdom and Rome divides the kingdom- Archelaus gets the kingdom of Jerusalem, Bethlahem and Antipas gets the kingdom of Nazareth, Gailee. At the end of the movie, Joseph, Mary, and Jesus return; but do not go to Bethlehem for fear of Herod's oldest son and instead go to Nazareth.",

    "user_prompt": "You will be given a summary of a story. You need to create a question that can be answered from the story. You can create a question about characters, events, facts and beliefs, etc. Your question should be specific, try not to use pronouns instead of full names. As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning.\n Froudacity is split into four books, each addressing specific topics that Froude brings. Thomas begins the preface by attacking the overarching claims that Froude uses to argue against self-governance. Thomas ridicules Froude's assertion that if blacks in West Indian countries were given the right to vote, they would elect a candidate that would strip away the rights of whites due to racial animosity. He also attacks the notion that West Indian blacks harbor animosity against whites by pointing out that as many blacks owned slaves as whites, and that most people who were alive during slavery have since died.\nIn Book I Thomas addresses Froude's claims in the early portions of The English in the West Indies. Froude's tendency to state incorrect assumptions as fact is roundly assaulted. Thomas criticizes Froude for making sweeping generalizations about the condition of blacks on multiple islands without ever talking or interacting with the people he was writing about. Thomas points out that Froude comments extensively on the lifestyles of the natives of Grenada when his only experience among the natives was peering into their houses as he rode past in a carriage. Thomas attacks many other different factual inaccuracies in Froude's work.\nIn Book II Thomas begins to directly address Froude's criticism of giving colonies self-rule. When Froude claims that leaders of the reform movements \"did not complain that their affairs had been ill-managed\" Thomas spends over two dozen pages detailing the gross abuses of power and corruption that many of the appointed governors of Trinidad have participated in. Thomas also debunks Froude's claim that the reformers pushed for reform in the hope that they would be elected and allowed to draw a handsome government salary. Thomas also points out that contrary to Froude's claims the reform movement has been active for decades. Thomas finishes the second book by refuting Froude's assertion that West Indian blacks were incredibly well taken care off by \"the beneficent despotism of the English Government\"\nThe 3rd book takes up half of Froudacity. It begins with Froude alleging that there are few black intellectuals. Thomas responds by accusing the West Indian governments of suppressing blacks and noting that many black intellectuals sprang up in America shortly after Emancipation because they were integrated into society. Thomas uses the examples of Fredrick Douglass and Chief Justice William Conrad Reeves extensively in his arguments about race and intelligence. Both men are black and highly successful. Thomas uses these men as examples of successful black intellectuals, who succeeded despite racism. Thomas convincingly counters Froude's cheerful view of slavery. Thomas continues to contest Froude's multiple accusations about the results of black ruling over whites and what the ideal governance situation is for the West Indies. When Froude brings up the old stereotypes of blacks being lazy, or being cannibals or devil-worshipers, Thomas quickly counters all of the accusations. Thomas goes on to note the rising prominence of Christianity among blacks, and engages in a discussion on the limits of science and religion.\nIn the final 4th book, Thomas discusses the history of blacks instead of analyzing The English in the West Indies. Thomas discusses the history of the development slavery in America and in the West Indies. Thomas details how slave owners in the West Indies became god-parents to their slaves through the Catholic Church, and through this process developed personal relationships with slaves devoid of cruelty. The institutions of slavery developed very differently in America and the West Indies. Thomas lists the great accomplishments achieved by the \"Negro Race\", predicting that these accomplishments will continue growing. Thomas encourages \"African descendants now dispersed in various countries of the Western Hemisphere ... at sufficient peace to begin occupying themselves about matters of racial importance\".",

    "user_prompt": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot. You need to read the extract and create questions that can be answered from the extract. Once you create a question you also need to provide the correct answer for it. Write your answer like \"Question: your question, Answer: your answer\". The questions should be well-formed and grammatically correct. The questions should be completely answerable from the given passage and should not require any external knowledge. Subjective questions are not allowed. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Create questions that result in factoid answers.  A simple rule of thumb to decide whether a question is a factoid or not is to see if two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage.\nMovie opens with a closeup of Dot (Camilla Belle), a deaf/mute high-schooler as her voiceover describes the more people in the room the more invisible she felt.Dot is sitting alone in a crowded cafeteria. At a table across from her, her new god-sister, Nina Deer (Elisha Cuthbert) and Nina's best friend Michelle (Katy Mixon) are loudly discussing Michelle's desire to have sex with a classmate/friend, Connor (Shawn Ashmore), who walks by. Nina notices Dot watching them and angrily snaps at Dot, who turns away, as Michelle playfully chides Nina for having a loser \"freak\" move into the family. A guidance counselor, Mrs. Feltswatter, asks Dot if she could join her at the table, at which Dot just ups and leaves. She retreats to her favorite hiding spot, a stall in the girl's bathroom, until Nina finds her and angrily pulls her out for the ride home.Back at the expansive, but cold and incompletely decorated, Deer home. Nina's mom and Dot's godmother, Olivia (Edie Falco), is preparing dinner and implores Nina and Michelle to try and accept Dot, who is sitting over at the table in the dining area, into the family. Nina retorts it wasn't her decision to take her in and insults Dot, who is oblivious to the conversation. Olivia reminds Nina that Dot can read lips. We learn that Olivia is an interior designer and Nina's dad and Dot's godfather, Paul (Martin Donovan), is a successful architect.Paul is at a pharmacy picking up prescription painkillers for Olivia when he bumps into Mrs. Feltswatter, the guidance counselor. She expresses concern that Dot is unhappy at school, and Paul informs her that Dot is living with them now and that her father had just died and her mother died ten years ago.Paul arrives home with the painkillers and greets the girls. Nina is finishing up cooking dinner and informs him that Olivia is passed out (sleeping) in the living room. He makes an irritated face and goes to get her. When he leaves, Nina grabs some painkiller pills from the bag and tries to get Dot to take some. She ignores Nina, who calls her an expletive and proceeds to down the painkillers herself.Meanwhile, Paul collects Olivia from the unfinished living room floor and puts her to bed, where he gives her some painkillers. Paul gives her a look while she's downing them and she insists they're for her hip pain. There is obvious tension between the two as she angrily points out that he thinks she's always doped up and doesn't do anything for the family.Back at the dinner table with Dot & Nina, Paul mentions it might be a good idea for them to go to some sign-language courses. Nina blows off the suggestion and says she can't believe Dot is staying, to her Dad's dismay. She then goes out, telling her Dad he should use the time to bond with his \"new daughter\".Next day at school, Dot gets paired up with Connor during a piglet dissection in science class. She ignores him, while she slashes away at the dead pig.In the cafeteria, Michelle is complaining to Nina and another cheerleader friend, Fiona, about the pairing of Connor and Dot as lab partners. The conversation turns to Nina, where she's goaded for still being a 17-year old virgin when she can have any guy she wants. Michelle makes fun of Dot at the other table, as she converses in sign language with one of the lunch ladies who has a deaf daughter.Dot is walking the school halls when she notices a piano in the empty music room. She enters and begins playing some slow Beethoven, while doing a voiceover about how Beethoven discovered he was going deaf and managed to continue to be inspired. Meanwhile Connor is walking by with his friend Brian and some others and notices Dot playing through the door window and begins to find himself attracted to her. He quickly pulls away when his friends want to see what he's looking at.Dot heads to off to the bathroom to hide out but bumps into Nina who's applying makeup there. Dot reluctantly allows Nina to put some lipstick on her, as Nina says she feels bad that they stopped seeing each other after Dot's mom died and if Dot had had some female influence while growing up she \"wouldn't look like a janitor all the time\". She leaves and Dot looks in the mirror to see that Nina had purposely smeared the lipstick all around her mouth like a clown.In her bedroom, unable to sleep, Dot pulls out a box that contains her father's ashes. Through her voiceover we discover that her father was deaf and was recently hit by a truck he couldn't hear and killed. This happened while Dot was with him at a restaurant and he went out to run across the street to a bank. She places some of the ashes on her fingers and then tastes them and places some on her face. She moves to the bathroom to wash it off, as she mentions that she may have been able to save him if she was with him.On the way back to her room, she notices Nina's bedroom door has opened a little and she peeks in and sees Nina and her Dad in bed together, and we hear him sweet talking her. Dot heads back to her bedroom, obviously disturbed, but she keeps it to herself.At the dinner table with Nina, Dot, Paul & Olivia, Nina says she's spending the night at Michelle's. Paul says she can't go since it's a school night. She pleads with her Mom, who questions why she can't go which prompts Paul to snap at her for always contradicting him. Nina then rubs his leg under the table with hers and says she finished all her homework. Her Mom says it's up to Paul, who doesn't answer now, so she gets up and leaves to go out when Michelle calls her cell. Paul gets up and has an argument with Olivia in the kitchen about undermining his authority in raising Nina and storms off. Olivia talks to Dot about her mother, who she was friends with in school, and calls her a \"big, old, lucky slut\" who didn't marry the first guy she went out with, unlike her and Paul.In the living room, Olivia is flipping through a patterns book and Dot hands her a note asking to go to the movies. Olivia says sure, but Paul overhears, and says she's in no condition to drive and he would drive her. In the car, Dot is obviously now uncomfortable being alone with Paul.In the near-empty movie theater Dot takes a spot up in the back row alone. Nina, Michelle, Fiona, Connor and Brian happen to come into the same theater and sit toward the bottom. Connor notices Dot, and asks if they should invite her to sit with them, where it's met with vehement disagreement from the others. Fiona remarks how screwed up it must be to never have heard anything. Nina says Dot was able to hear until around the time her Mom died when she was seven, and how it was probably worse to have lost it than never to have heard in the first place. As the movie begins playing Nina, begins inconspicuously covering her ears to see what it's like to be deaf, but stops when she sees Dot staring down at her.Back at Michelle's, she and Nina are on Michelle's bed watching a scene of two people passionately kissing. Michelle asks Nina how you would know if you were a bad kisser, to which Nina doesn't know the answer to. Michelle suggests the only way would be kiss someone you really trust and ask them how it was. This advance by Michelle goes right by Nina who is engrossed in the movie.Dot still unable to sleep, sees Paul coming down the stairs. She fakes sleeping as Paul enters her room. Thinking she's asleep, he sits on her bed, and as he's stroking her hair, he whispers to her that he's sick and that he thought things might change when she came to live with them. He says, \"I hate it here\" and leaves.Back to Michelle's bedroom, she asks Nina if there was one place you could go where would it be. She replies Australia because it's really far away.Next day at the cafeteria, Dot is alone at her table again. Connor, Brian, Michelle & Nina are at the table across from her. They are discussing plans where Brian's parents are going away and he'll have a small party, with drinks for all. Michelle suggests Nina can sneak out and snag some drugs from her mom, since she's a \"prescriptoholic.\" Nina is not amused and is not sure she can come, but Michelle goads her, as she sees this as a chance to get to sleep with Connor.Dot is alone at home playing some classical piece on the piano in the main room. Unbeknownst to Dot, Nina comes home, hears the music and is quietly listening to it in the doorway. While playing, a piano wire suddenly snaps and Dot curses out loud, startling Nina who quickly ducks around the corner. Dot begins to try to find the damaged piano key by tuning along with her voice to the keys, with Nina all the while listening to this, now knowing that Dot's deafness is not at all as it seems. She sneaks back to the door, slams it as if she just came in and greets Dot, who has now stopped playing, without letting on about what she just witnessed.At the cafeteria the next day, Nina, goes over to Dot's table, who is as usual alone, and pulls a chair right up next to Dot. While Dot is eating her sandwich and staring straight ahead, supposedly ignoring Nina, Nina talks directly and angrily into her ear how much she hated her, the lovehate relationship with her own Dad with all the lurid details of their incestuous encounters and her plans to kill him in the middle of the night with a gun (supplied by Michelle, who will steal it from her Dad) while Mom is drugged out and Dot \"can't hear\". We can see that Dot is disturbed by these confessions, but she keeps her reactions in check. Angry that she couldn't goad a response out of Dot, Nina storms off.Dot is back at the school piano again, when she notices Connor watching her through the door. Connor stops her as she tries to leave and tries to set up a date where they can work on the lab report together. She pulls the already completed report out of her bag, gives it to him and leaves to his dismay.While the Deers are at the dinner table, Connor stops by and surprises Nina who was expecting Michelle. He asks if Dot can come to the library to go over the lab report. Meanwhile Michelle arrives for the secret party with a brown bag and gives it to Nina. Dot notices the bag and is visibly affected. Nina notices and rhetorically asks Dot what she's looking at, at which Dot gets up and leaves with Connor.Dot and Connor are at a diner. He starts off with small talk about the lab report, but eventually begins confessing things about himself and his feelings towards Dot, including asking if she's a virgin like him. She does not respond or acknowledge. Meanwhile Nina and Michelle are up in her room, discussing nipples, when Paul comes up and tells her to send Michelle home because it's a school night. Nina tells her she can't come to the party and Michelle leaves angry.Dot sees an ambulance drive by at the diner and rushes home where she finds the bag Michelle brought over sitting on a chair in the dining room. She opens it and finds it not to contain a gun, but instead porn DVD's. She sneaks over to Nina's room where she discovers Nina and her dad about to have sex. She breaks a statue against the wall to break it up. Nina, taken off guard, comes out and helps her clean it up, while Paul emerges and tells her to be more careful around the house. He goes back to his bedroom where he tries to say something to Olivia, but she is faking being asleep.Nina is back in her bed crying, and she thinks her Dad is coming back in so she says she's tired, but it's Dot, who gets into the bed and puts her arm around Nina to comfort her as she goes to sleep.The next morning Dot is still in Nina's room and Nina is ironing her cheerleader outfit, at which point she infers to Dot that midnight tonight will be the night she kills her dad for sure with the iron, burns the face off a teddy bear for effect and throws it to Dot. She is still unaware that Nina knows she is not deaf, and Nina tells her it's a good thing she's deaf because she could be considered an accomplice.At night, outside the school gymnasium where Connor is playing in a basketball game, Dot dials Child Welfare on a pay phone, but decides to hang up when someone answers. She enters the gymnasium and watches the game where Connor is playing so bad he gets benched. Nina, Michele and Fiona are there as part of the cheerleading squad.After the game, Dot stops Connor and pulls him into the empty and darkened school swimming pool building. Connor is talking to Dot by the pool about going on road trips with her and how quiet it would be, but when she's not looking he's confessing about how many times he masturbates and how he's a sex addict, who sucks at basketball.Meanwhile, back in Paul & Olivia's bedroom, she pops some more pills and mentions to Paul that Connor would be a cute guy for Nina. Paul gets mad and tells her to be careful about pushing her into dating and dressing like a slut. She comes out of the master bathroom and disrobes asking Paul if she's getting fat. Paul emphatically ignores her advances and gets into bed to go to sleep. Olivia calls him mean and says she's sleeping on the floor. Paul tells her to get into bed, but she refuses so he picks her up and throws her onto the bed and he goes downstairs.Back at the pool, Connor and Dot have gotten closer and while she's not looking he is confessing to her how he has kissed lots of girls but has never \"done it\", at which point she sits up, and to Connor's surprise, takes her shirt off, does the same for him, and they begin to kiss.Back at the Deer house Nina comes home alone and encounters her Dad who is eating ice cream in the kitchen. He tells her he has a present for her and gives her an expensive pocketbook after which he makes advances toward her. She stops him, removes her cheerleader dress and tells him she'll be in her bedroom.Back at the school, Connor and Dot are having sex poolside, though she doesn't seem to be enjoying it. When it's over she notices the clock nearing midnight so she rushes back to the house.Back the Deer house, Paul quietly took a candle out of the bedside table and headed back to Nina's room, though we see that Olivia is definitely awake. Nina is ironing her skirt to put it away, while holding off her Dad's advances. She tells him she has a surprise for him and to sit on the bed with his eyes closed. He does so and she walks up to him and is about to ram the hot iron into his face when Dot comes home and slams the front door. Dot listens by the door. Nina chickens out and ends up telling her dad that she's pregnant with his child. He gets upset and asks if she's sure and what's she's going to do about it. Nina gets mad and says she doesn't want a baby with webbed feet running around the house and needs $1000 cash tomorrow to get an abortion. He agrees and leaves.Nina goes to Dot's room, gets into bed with her and confesses that she's wasn't brave enough to do it.At the lunch line in the cafeteria the next day Connor asks Dot to go to the Spring Fling dance with him, via translation from the lunch lady. Dot says no and that she's wrong for him and she needs to be by herself and leaves. Michelle and Nina, who were in the same line witness it and Michelle begins to curse out Dot, when Nina cuts her off and tells her to back off.Back in Dot's room that night, Nina brings her a dress for the dance to try to get her to go and confesses to Dot that she will be taking the $1000 and running off to get started in Connecticut where she can be a stripper and makes lots of money and even become famous like Courtney Love, who was one. She says it was so hard lying about being pregnant that part of her thinks it's true. She puts the lipstick on Dot again, but this time it's perfectly applied and leaves to get ready.In the bathroom, Dot is holding the dress up to herself to see how it looks in the mirror. Nina comes in and Dot begins to wipe off the lipstick and puts down the dress. She's not going. Nina asks Dot to let her in on her secret, but she walks away.Olivia is downstairs in the dark staring at the blank walls. Dot is downstairs playing Moonlight Sonata on the piano. Nina sneaks into her parents bedroom to steal some of her mom's pills and finishes getting ready in the master bedroom. Meanwhile Paul is looking for Nina and notices tampons in her new bag. He grabs the bag and begins badgering Nina in the bedroom about the \"pregnancy\". He then confronts Nina about the tampons where she at first says they belonged to Michelle and she was holding them for her since she had no bag. He doesn't buy it, throws the $1000 at Nina and calls her a whore. He begins slapping Nina around and then begins to force himself on her. Olivia hears all this and is crying downstairs, but does nothing. Dot hears, stops playing and rips out a piano wire. She heads upstairs, comes up behind Paul and strangles him with it, while screaming for him to leave Nina alone. Nina drops to the body screaming at Dot for killing her Daddy. Olivia comes upstairs in a daze and says it's a miracle that Dot can speak.Michelle and Fiona show up to pick up Nina for the dance and Dot tells Nina that they have to bury the backpack (presumably with their bloody clothes in it). Dot goes to the dance with them, but gets intercepted there by Connor who makes her dance with him. Nina takes the backpack and hides in the bathroom stall with it.Meanwhile, we see Olivia sitting in the bedroom, contemplating, with Paul's bloody body at her feet.Dot leaves Connor abruptly on the dance floor and he follows her out. He calls out for her to wait and when she stops with her back to him, he knows now that she can hear and tells her to turn around. Obviously distressed, he berates her for actually hearing his dirty secrets, calls her a psycho and tells her to shove off, as she tries to apologize to him.She continues on to collect Nina from the bathroom and they run out through the woods to a creek where they bury the backpack. Nina asked why Dot pretended to be deaf all this time and she replied she wanted to be closer to her father and farther from everyone else. They head back home walking through the creek.When they arrive back at the house police are everywhere, and they are leading Nina's mom out in handcuffs. They run up to her and Olivia tells Nina that she did a terrible thing in that she killed her father when he started going crazy, breaking things and saying he hated her, so she took a piano wire and strangled him with it. She tells Nina she never wanted him to hurt her and if she could ever forgive her, as they take her away in the police car.Fade to the piano in the house during the day where Nina is tentatively playing on it. Dot comes up and joins her as the camera pulls away from them.Nina used to think she would not even have a funeral....and now, with her Daddy/tormentor dead, she has a chance at life....",

You can create a question about characters, events, facts and beliefs, etc. Your question should be specific, try not to use pronouns instead of full names. As the stories are sometimes movie plots, they will contain actor names in parentheses. You should not use those names. Only use character names. Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning.\n The novel begins when \"Edward Henry Machin first saw the smoke on May 27, 1867\" the very day of Bennett's own birth. At age 12, Denry begins his career by altering his marks in a test sufficiently to earn him a scholarship to grammar school. At 16, he leaves school to work for Mr Duncalf, the town clerk and a solicitor. Duncalf is responsible for organizing an exclusive ball; Denry \"invites\" himself, then also a few others in exchange for things he will need, such as lessons from dance instructor Ruth Earp. On a bet, he audaciously asks the energetic, beautiful Countess of Chell to dance. Everyone, including Machin, is in awe of the Countess (apparently based on the real-life Duchess of Sutherland) and he thus earns himself the reputation of a \"card\" (a \"character\", someone able to set tongues wagging)   a reputation he is determined to cement.\nLater, when Duncalf treats a disgruntled client brusquely, Denry leaves his employ after persuading the client to hire him as a rent collector. When some of the tenants fall behind, he begins loaning them money (at a highly profitable interest rate). Ruth herself is several months in arrears and tries to sneak away in the middle of the night. Denry catches her by accident, but rather than being angry, he admires her audacity and starts courting her.\nWhile on holiday at the seaside resort town of Llandudno with Ruth and her friend Nellie Cotterill, he witnesses a shipwreck and the rescue of the sailors. Noting the interest generated, he buys a lifeboat, hires some of the stranded mariners as rowers, and conducts tours of the picturesque wreck. However, Ruth's spendthrift nature becomes alarmingly apparent during the trip and they break up.\nBy the end of the summer, Denry has made a substantial profit from the sightseers, which he uses to finance his boldest venture. He starts up the Five Towns Universal Thrift Club. Members deposit money little by little; once they have accumulated half the sum they need to purchase whatever it is they want, the club allows them to buy on credit, but only from stores associated with the club. Denry makes money by getting a discount from the vendors in return for access to his large customer base. When his capital starts to run out, he arranges an \"accident\" for the Countess's coach. He drives conveniently by and gives her a lift to an urgent appointment. On the way there, he talks her into becoming the club's sponsor, ensuring easy financing. This proves to be the making of Denry's fortune.\nWith his great success, he is appointed a town councillor. He also backs a new daily newspaper (to be bought out at a profit by its established rival anxious to keep its monopoly) and tricks his obstinate mother into moving into a luxurious new house. At this point, Ruth reappears in Denry's life, now the widow of a rich older man. He considers renewing their relationship, but at the last moment, realizes that Nellie is the one for him and marries her.\nThe crowning achievement comes when Denry decides to become the youngest mayor in the history of Bursley. To sway the voters, he purchases the rights to footballer and native son Callear, the \"greatest centre forward in England\", for the failing Bursley football club.\nHis antics are regarded with affection and admiration by most others, as shown by the book's final exchange:\n\"What a card!\" said one, laughing joyously. \"He's a rare 'un, no mistake.\"\n\"Of course, this'll make him more popular than ever,\" said another. \"We've never had a man to touch him for that.\"\n\"And yet,\" demanded Councillor Barlow, \"what's he done? Has he ever done a day's work in his life? What great cause is he identified with?\"\n\"He's identified,\" said the speaker, \"with the great cause of cheering us all up.\"",

While Chad focuses his energy on winning the affections of uninterested Michelle, Matt comes up with the cinematic construct of a stranger with a paper bag on his head terrorizing a group of people in the woods. After the initial evening of alcoholic brainstorming, though, the idea becomes reality, and the friends' relationships are tested as they find themselves in a truly scary situation.The idea for BAGHEAD was hatched on the set of the THE PUFFY CHAIR when, during a discussion requesting those involved to think of the scariest thing imaginable, someone said, \"A guy with a bag on his head staring into your window.\" Though it may be a flimsy starting point for a film, the Duplasses surround the idea with a believable cast, truthful insight into relationships, and a few genuine chills.

In this paper, we present a novel approach, namely  Partially-Connected DARTS, by sampling a small part of super-net to reduce the redundancy in exploring the network space, thereby performing a more efficient search without comprising the performance. In particular, we perform operation search in a subset of channels while bypassing the held out part in a shortcut. This strategy may suffer from an undesired inconsistency on selecting the edges of super-net caused by sampling different channels. We solve it by introducing  edge normalization, which adds a new set of edge-level hyper-parameters to reduce uncertainty in search. Thanks to the reduced memory cost, PC-DARTS can be trained with a larger batch size and, consequently, enjoy both faster speed and higher training stability. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, we achieve an error rate of 2.57% on CIFAR10 within merely 0.1 GPU-days for architecture search, and a state-of-the-art top-1 error rate of 24.2% on ImageNet (under the mobile setting) within 3.8 GPU-days for search.

Karen Ross (Laura Linney), assisting at TraviCom's headquarters, does not hear back from their team and activates a remote camera at the camp, discovering the camp destroyed and numerous corpses; something large suddenly knocks over and destroys the camera. Karen alerts TraviCom's CEO and Charles' father, R.B. Travis (Joe Don Baker), who informs her that the group was really there looking for a rare blue diamond only found there which would greatly enhance their capabilities, but does not offer any hope to rescue them. Travis implores Karen to lead an expedition and she makes Travis swear that he is sending her to look for Charles, not the diamond.Meanwhile, Dr. Peter Elliott (Dylan Walsh), a primatologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and his assistant Richard (Grant Heslov) teach human communication to primates using a gorilla named Amy (voiced by Shayna Fox). With a special backpack and glove, her sign language is translated to a digitized voice. Despite the success, Peter is concerned that Amy is having nightmares and psychological problems, due to several drawings Amy has made of jungles and the Eye of Providence. Peter attempts to gain funding to take Amy to Africa, but the university is reluctant, and Peter begins inquiring elsewhere. Romanian philanthropist Herkermer Homolka (Tim Curry) offers to fund the expedition; Karen, having learned of the trip, offers to fund it as well and to come along, hoping to discover the fate of her team.In Africa, the group meets their expert guide Captain Munro Kelly (Ernie Hudson) but they are captured by the local authorities and militia leader named Captain Wanta (Delroy Lindo) who grants them passage for a sizable bribe. As the group boards another plane, Munro reveals that Homolka has led previous safaris in search of the \"Lost City of Zinj\", with disastrous results. The group must parachute into the jungle after their plane is shot down by Zairean soldiers.On the ground, they encounter a native Ghost Tribe. The tribe leads them to Bob Driscoll (John Hawkes), a member of Charles' expedition, who they have been attempting to revive from his catatonic state. On seeing Amy, Bob begins screaming and soon dies. They continue by boat, and learn that Homolka is interested in finding Zinj and its fabled diamond mine; Homolka believes that Amy's drawings suggests she has seen the mine and hopes she will lead them there. They find the ruined camp and Zinj nearby. While searching the city, Richard is attacked by a killer grey gorilla, which the rest of the team take down. They take shelter at the ruined camp, other grey gorillas kept at bay by automated sentry guns set up by Karen.When day breaks, they return to the city, discovering hieroglyphs that say that the people had taught the grey gorillas, a unique species due to the volcanic environment, to guard the mine and kill anyone that approached it. The group suspects that the gorillas turned on their masters but still protect the mine now. They find the diamond mine and Homolka starts to collect large diamonds, but a pack of gorillas appear and kill him. Munro, Karen, and Peter fight off the gorillas and flee deeper into the mine, where they discover Charles' body, holding a giant blue diamond. As Amy helps to fend off the gorillas, Karen is able to fit the diamond into a portable laser, using it to fire and ward off the gorillas. The volcano begins to erupt, and Munro, Karen, Peter, and Amy escape as the city is flooded with lava, killing the gorillas.Karen contacts Travis to report on finding the diamond and confirming Charles' death. When she sees Travis is only worried about the diamond, she uses her laser to destroy the TraviCom satellite. In the nearby wreckage of a cargo plane, they find a usable hot-air balloon, and prepare to leave. Peter sees Amy watch a pack of mountain gorillas nearby, and lets her go, telling her goodbye. The three take off in the balloon, and Karen has Peter throw away the diamond as they leave.",

The aim of any cavalry charge is to scatter the enemy lines and frighten the enemy off the battlefield.

When the police pass by, he gets out, and the carriage rolls down the hill, smashing into a rock and sending the money flying into Bugs' hole. Bugs is overjoyed to suddenly be showered with money, but Finster is less impressed, and begins working on a scheme to get the money back.Finster uses his baby disguise to convince Bugs he is an abandoned child, and Bugs takes him in. Finster initially dives for the money, but Bugs (who is unaware of the money's origin) forces him away from it and puts him in a playpen. Finster responds by holding his breath until he turns blue, and a concerned Bugs gives him the money.Later, Bugs tries to give Finster some milk, but discovers he has escaped from his playpen. Finster almost escapes with the money after whacking Bugs over the head with it, but Bugs takes him back in and puts the money on a high shelf. Finster responds by threatening Bugs with a \"toy\" pistol, which he fires and leaves Bugs substantially dazed. Bugs then decides to put Finster to bed.After being tucked in, Finster beats Bugs with a baseball bat when he tries to turn out the lights. After this happens twice, Bugs tests Finster by saying \"Click,\" and is promptly beaten. Finster makes it appear as though he were having a nightmare, so Bugs lets him be.Bugs goes to turn on the television, but the signal is distorted by a loud buzzing noise.

The game opened well for the Colts, who scored on their opening drive with a Curtis Painter to Pierre Gar&#231;on touchdown reception. In the second quarter, the Colts scored with an Adam Vinatieri field goal and another Painter to Gar&#231;on touchdown, giving Indianapolis a 17-0 lead midway through the second quarter.  A Kansas City touchdown pass from Matt Cassel ended the shutout but Indianapolis scored another touchdown later. A late Kansas City touchdown allowed the Colts to go into halftime with a 24-14 lead. Two touchdown passes from Cassel, to Dwayne Bowe and Steve Breaston respectively, gave the Chiefs 21 unanswered points and completed the comeback, winning the game 28-24, dropping the Colts to 0-5 on the season.",

This is commonly interpreted in two ways:, James Naismith (November 6, 1861  November 28, 1939) was a Canadian-American physical educator, physician, chaplain, sports coach and innovator. He invented the game of basketball at age 30 in 1891. He wrote the original basketball rule book and founded the University of Kansas basketball program. Naismith lived to see basketball adopted as an Olympic demonstration sport in 1904 and as an official event at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, as well as the birth of the National Invitation Tournament (1938) and the NCAA Tournament (1939). , Egypt (; ', , \"Kimi\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt is a Mediterranean country bordered by the Gaza Strip and Israel to the northeast, the Gulf of Aqaba to the east, the Red Sea to the east and south, Sudan to the south, and Libya to the west. Across the Gulf of Aqaba lies Jordan, and across from the Sinai Peninsula lies Saudi Arabia, although Jordan and Saudi Arabia do not share a land border with Egypt. It is the world's only contiguous Afrasian nation., Cyprus , officially the Republic of Cyprus, is an island country in the Eastern Mediterranean and the third largest and third most populous island in the Mediterranean. It is located south of Turkey, west of Syria and Lebanon, northwest of Israel and Palestine, north of Egypt, and southeast of Greece., Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\"\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. \nGreece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki., The Kansas Jayhawks, commonly referred to as KU, are the teams of the athletic department at the University of Kansas. KU is one of three schools in the state of Kansas that participate in NCAA Division I. The Jayhawks are also a member of the Big 12 Conference. University of Kansas athletic teams have won eleven NCAA Division I championships: three in men's basketball, one in men's cross country, three in men's indoor track and field, three in men's outdoor track and field, and one in women's outdoor track and field., The Pancyprian Gymnastic Association Stadium (GSP Stadium) is a football stadium in Nicosia, Cyprus. Although small by international standards, it is the largest stadium in Cyprus, with a capacity of 22,859 and was opened in 1999. It serves as the home stadium for the two Nicosia's biggest clubs APOEL and Omonia. It is also the home stadium of the Cyprus national football team. A stadium under the same name, the old GSP Stadium, existed from 1902 until 1999 in the centre of Nicosia and had a capacity of 12,000., Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history., Syria, officially known as the Syrian Arab Republic (\"\"), is a country in Western Asia, bordering Lebanon and the Mediterranean Sea to the west, Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, Jordan to the south, and Israel to the southwest. Syria's capital and largest city is Damascus., The Summer Olympic Games or the Games of the Olympiad, first held in 1896, is an international multi-sport event that is hosted by a different city every four years. The most recent Olympics were held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The International Olympic Committee organizes the games and oversees the host city's preparations. In each Olympic event, gold medals are awarded for first place, silver medals are awarded for second place, and bronze medals are awarded for third; this tradition began in 1904. The Winter Olympic Games were created due to the success of the Summer Olympics., A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective. A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win. Examples are basketball, volleyball, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey., Makario Stadium, is an all-seater multi-purpose stadium in Nicosia, Cyprus. It was the largest and main sports venue of the capital up to the construction of the GSP stadium in 1999. At present it is mostly used for football matches and is the home ground of Digenis Morphou and Ethnikos Assia. The stadium holds 16,000 seated spectators. The playing field is surrounded by a running track and can be adapted to hold most track and field events. Apart from corporate boxes and the press centre, there are no coverings for spectators. , The Lefkotheo arena was the first major indoor sports hall to be constructed in Cyprus . Its construction was finished in 1980 , and it is located next to the Makario Stadium with which it shares a common car park . It caters for basketball , volleyball and handball matches but can also be converted to host badminton , gymnastics and boxing matches . It has a crowd capacity of 2,100 seated spectators . The arena played host to many events during the 1989 Games of the Small States of Europe . Now the arena is used only by the basketball and volleyball departments of APOEL ., Israel , officially known as the State of Israel, is a country in the Middle East, on the southeastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea and the northern shore of the Red Sea. It has land borders with Lebanon to the north, Syria to the northeast, Jordan on the east, the Palestinian territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the east and west, respectively, and Egypt to the southwest. The country contains geographically diverse features within its relatively small area. Israel's financial and technology center is Tel Aviv, while its seat of government and proclaimed capital is Jerusalem, although the state's sovereignty over the city of Jerusalem is internationally unrecognized., Multi-purpose stadiums are a type of stadium designed to be easily used by multiple types of events. While any stadium could potentially host more than one type of sport or event, this concept usually refers to a specific design philosophy that stresses multifunctionality over specificity. It is used most commonly in Canada and the United States, where the two most popular outdoor team sports  football and baseball  require radically different facilities. Football uses a rectangular field (Canadian football fields are larger than American ones), while baseball is played on a diamond and large outfield. This requires a particular design to accommodate both, usually an oval. While building stadiums in this way means that sports teams and governments can share costs, it also imposes some challenges., Nicosia (is the largest city on the island of Cyprus. It is located near the centre of the Mesaoria plain, on the banks of the River Pedieos., Lebanon , officially known as the Lebanese Republic, is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south, while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea. Lebanon's location at the crossroads of the Mediterranean Basin and the Arabian hinterland facilitated its rich history and shaped a cultural identity of religious and ethnic diversity. At just 10,452\u00a0km (4,036 sq. mi.), it is the smallest recognized country on the entire mainland Asian continent., Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net.

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.\nContext_1 : Mega Man Xtreme 2, known as Rockman X2: Soul Eraser (\u30ed\u30c3\u30af\u30de\u30f3X2 \u30bd\u30a6\u30eb\u30a4\u30ec\u30a4\u30b6\u30fc ) in Japan, is a video game developed by Capcom for the Game Boy Color handheld game console. It is a spin-off title in the \"Mega Man X\" series and is a follow-up to \"Mega Man Xtreme\", released the previous year. \"Mega Man Xtreme 2\" takes place during the 22nd century, in an unknown year 21XX, between the events of \"Mega Man X3\" and \"Mega Man X4\". The DNA souls of robots known as \"Reploids\" all around the world are being stolen by a pair of villains in order to create an army of undead \"Mavericks\". The \"Maverick Hunters\" Mega Man X and Zero quickly spring into action, now with the help of their young ally Iris. Context_2 : A swallow's nest organ (French: \"orgue en nid d'hirondelle\" , German: \"Schwalbennestorgel\" ) is form of pipe organ which takes its name from its resemblance to the nests built by swallows. Rather than placed on a gallery or on the floor, the swallow's nest organ case sits on a platform suspended on a wall, with the wall as its sole support. In some churches it was wedged into the triforium (a shallow arched gallery built into a wall above the nave). In swallow's nest organs from the Renaissance period, the base of the suspended platform, called a \"tribuna\", typically tapered into a point. There is generally only room in a swallow's nest for one person, the organist, who accesses it by a ladder or from a staircase concealed behind the wall. Context_3 : Henry O. Studley (1838-1925) was an organ and piano maker, carpenter, and Mason who worked for the Smith Organ Co., and later for the Poole Piano Company of Quincy, Massachusetts. Born in 1838 in Lowell, Massachusetts, Studley is best known for creating the so-called Studley Tool Chest, a wall hanging tool chest which cunningly holds 245 tools in a space that takes up about 40 by 20 inches (102 \u00d7 51 cm) of wall space when closed. Studley joined the Massachusetts Infantry at the start of the Civil War and was captured in Galveston, Texas in 1863. After the war he returned to Quincy and joined the Rural Masonic Lodge. He died in 1925 and was remembered in his obituary in the Quincy \"Patriot-Ledger\" for his remarkable tool chest, among his other achievements. Context_4 : An annual calendar is a representation of the year that expires with the year represented, or that must be altered annually to remain current. The term takes different but related meanings across two contexts. One is for static (synchronic) calendars, such as wall calendars or calendar systems. The other is for dynamic (diachronic) calendars, such as digital calendars or timepieces. Static representations of the Gregorian calendar year are annual, because the weekdays of Gregorian dates vary from year to year. The calendar representing one year will not serve for the next year. With perennial calendars, the same representation of the year serves for every year. Perpetual calendars, in this context, are computation devices for determining the weekdays of dates in any given year, or for representing a wide range of annual calendars. Context_5 : Smoky Wall ( ) is a prominent mountain block, 1,840 m, in the northwest part of the Salvesen Range of South Georgia. The name \"Wetterwand\" (weather wall) was given to this mountain by the German group of the International Polar Year Investigations, 1882\u201383, but the name did not become established. The feature was surveyed by the SGS, 1951\u201352, who reported that when viewed from the northeast, its summit is level and regular and has the appearance of a wall. The descriptive name Smoky Wall was recommended by the United Kingdom Antarctic Place-Names Committee (UK-APC) in 1954. Context_6 : Woods Runner is a 2010 young adult novel by Gary Paulsen that takes place during the year 1776. It is about a 13-year-old boy named Samuel living during the Revolutionary War whose house is burnt down by British soldiers. When Samuel investigates the scene of devastation, he finds dead bodies, but none of the bodies were his parents. The parents were not killed because one of the officer wanted somebody to play with in chess.Samuel starts a journey to find his parents in New York but gets hit in the head with a tomahawk and with the help of rebels is healed. Before Samuel finds his parents and is able to save them with the help of a man named Abner he saves a little girl named Annie and takes her with him on his journey. Samuel's family then adopts Annie as their own daughter. The novel ends by saying that Samuel decided to go to war but returned home after a man who had helped him earlier died. Context_7 : Flowers on the Wall is the debut studio album by the Statler Brothers. It produced their debut single \"Flowers on the Wall\", a Top 5 country and pop hit that year. Members of Johnny Cash's band, the Tennessee Three played on the album, as it was recorded in between takes during the recording of a Johnny Cash album. Context_8 : A Carnot wall is a type of loop-holed wall built in the ditch of a fort or redoubt. It takes its name from the French mathematician, politician, and military engineer, Lazare Carnot. Such walls were introduced into the design of fortifications from the early nineteenth century. As conceived by Carnot they formed part of an innovative but controversial system of fortification intended to defend against artillery and infantry attack. Carnot walls were employed, together with other elements of Carnot's system, in continental Europe in the years after the final defeat of Napoleon in 1815, especially by the Prussians, other Germans and Austrians. Their adoption was initially resisted by the French themselves and by the British. Context_9 : Lazare Nicolas Marguerite, Count Carnot (13 May 1753 \u2013 2 August 1823) was a French politician, engineer, freemason and mathematician. He was known as the \"Organizer of Victory\" in the French Revolutionary Wars. Context_10 : Littlehampton Redoubt, usually known as Littlehampton Fort, was built in 1854 to protect the entrance to the River Arun at Littlehampton on the south coast of England, against possible attack by the French under the Emperor Napoleon III. There had been a previous battery on the east bank of the river, but the new fort was built on the west bank. It consisted of a platform from which cannon could sweep the harbour mouth, with a barracks behind and a surrounding defensive ditch and wall. The fort was an innovative military structure, incorporating the new feature of a Carnot wall. Its active use as a fort was short at only about 20 years, owing to technical changes in armaments, but it was a precursor of the later Palmerston Forts. Having had various uses since decommissioning, it is now in a ruinous and overgrown state. fact_1 : A Carnot wall is a type of loop-holed wall built in the ditch of a fort or redoubt. fact_2 :  It takes its name from the French mathematician, politician, and military engineer, Lazare Carnot. fact_3 : Lazare Nicolas Marguerite, Count Carnot (13 May 1753 \u2013 2 August 1823) was a French politician, engineer, freemason and mathematician.

    "user_prompt": "In this task, you will be shown an extract from a movie plot. You need to read the extract and create questions that can be answered from the extract. Once you create a question you also need to provide the correct answer for it. Write your answer like \"Question: your question, Answer: your answer\". The questions should be well-formed and grammatically correct. The questions should be completely answerable from the given passage and should not require any external knowledge. Subjective questions are not allowed. Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Create questions that result in factoid answers.  A simple rule of thumb to decide whether a question is a factoid or not is to see if two different people with average reading/comprehension skills would come up with the same answer after reading the passage.\nIn 1965, Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is a professional musician and composer who has been relatively successful in the exhausting life of a musician. However, in an attempt to enjoy more free time with his young wife, Iris (Glenne Headly), and to enable him to compose a piece of orchestral music, the 30-year-old Holland accepts a high school teaching position.Unfortunately for Holland, he is soon forced to realize that his position as a music teacher makes him a marginalized figure in the faculty's hierarchy. Many of his colleagues, and some in the school's administration, including the school's principal (Olympia Dukakis) and vice principal (William H. Macy), resent Holland and question the value and importance of music education given the school's strained budget. However, he quickly begins to win many of his colleagues over. In the classroom, Holland finds success utilizing rock and roll as a way to make classical music more accessible to his students. Gradually, stubbornly, he begins to see his students as individuals and begins finding ways to help them excel.When Iris becomes pregnant, Holland uses the money saved up to produce his orchestration in order to buy a house. Their son Cole is born during the summer following his first year as a teacher. When school resumes, Holland is put in charge of the school marching band. The school's football coach Bill (Jay Thomas) helps him in exchange for allowing an academically challenged football player/wrestler named Louis Russ (Terrence Howard) to play the drums for academic credit so he can keep his spot on the wrestling team.At home, Holland's lack of quality time with his wife creates tension. When their son Cole is diagnosed as deaf, Holland reacts with hostility to the news that he can never teach the joys of music to his own child. His wife willingly learns American Sign Language to communicate with their son. However, Holland, acting out of frustration and resentment, learns at a much slower rate, causing further estrangement within the family.Over three decades, Holland forms closer relationships with his students at John F. Kennedy High School than with his own son. At one point in the film, he is briefly tempted by the shining singing talent and beauty of Rowena Morgan (Jean Louisa Kelly), who invites him to leave his stressful, unsatisfying life and run off to New York City with her. While greatly attracted to Rowena, Holland decides that he must stay with his family.In a conversation with Cole, about the recent murder of John Lennon in 1980, Holland coldly claims that Cole, being deaf, can never understand what music means to him. Cole lashes out and reveals that he does appreciate music but needs his father to reach out to him. The incident encourages Holland to find different ways for Cole and other deaf children to experience music, and he puts on a concert for them during which he sings and signs John Lennon's Beautiful Boy, directing the song towards Cole.Holland addresses a series of challenges created by people who are either skeptical of, or hostile towards, the idea of musical excellence within the walls of the average middle-class American high school. Holland inspires and touches the lives of many of his students but always seems to have too little time for himself or his family, forever delaying the composition of his own orchestral work. Ultimately, he reaches an age when it is too late to realistically find financial backing or ever have the composition performed.In 1995, the adversaries of the Kennedy High music program win a decisive institutional victory. The school's former vice principal, now promoted to principal, works with the school board to eliminate funding for the music program along with other fine arts programs, thereby leading to Holland's early retirement at the age of 60. Holland protests to the school board that eliminating the arts will have negative impact on students, but is overruled. Holland realizes that his career in music is likely over. He believes that his former students have mostly forgotten him and is dejected at his failure to ever have his composition, which he views as his life's work, performed.On his final day as a teacher, Iris and Cole, now an adult and a teacher himself, arrive to help Holland pack up. Because of his disappointment over his self-perceived lack of achievement, in a prearranged plan, Iris and Cole lead Holland to the school auditorium where he is surprised to find a gathering of many of his former students, now grown. Hearing that their beloved teacher is retiring, the students have secretly returned to the school to celebrate his career.Holland's orchestral piece, never before played, has been distributed to the students by Iris and Cole. One of his most musically challenged students, now Governor of Oregon, sits with her clarinet. The students ask their former teacher to serve as conductor for the premiere performance of Mr. Holland's Opus (\"The American Symphony\"). As Holland conducts the orchestra of his former students, a proud Iris and Cole look on, appreciating the affection and respect that Holland receives. Holland, overwhelmed with emotion, finally realizes his masterpiece.",

They spoke English and a foreign language. They were clean-shaven. They wore dark jeans and nice shoes, and they weren't from the Ivory Coast.

The painter and diarist Joseph Farington recorded that this was a result of the poor engravings:\nWest said He looked over the Shakespeare prints and was sorry to see them of such inferior quality.  He said that excepting that from His Lear by Sharpe, that from Northcote's children in the Tower, and some small ones, there were few that could be approved.  Such a mixture of dotting and engraving, and such a general deficiency in respect of drawing which He observed the Engravers seemed to know little of, that the volumes presented a mass of works which He did not wonder many subscribers had declined to continue their subscription.\nThe mix of engraving styles was criticised; line engraving was considered the superior form and artists and subscribers disliked the mixture of lesser forms with it. Moreover, Boydell's engravers fell behind schedule, delaying the entire project. He was forced to engage lesser artists, such as Hamilton and Smirke, at a lower price to finish the volumes as his business started to fail. Modern art historians have generally concurred that the quality of the engravings, particularly in the folio, was poor. Moreover, the use of so many different artists and engravers led to a lack of stylistic cohesion.Although the Boydells ended with 1,384 subscriptions, the rate of subscriptions dropped, and remaining subscriptions were also increasingly in doubt.  Like many businesses at the time, the Boydell firm kept few records. Only the customers knew what they had purchased.  This caused numerous difficulties with debtors who claimed they had never subscribed or had subscribed for less.  Many subscribers also defaulted, and Josiah Boydell spent years after John's death attempting to force them to pay.",

Your task is to generate answer for given question based on set of context paragraphs and supporting facts.\nContext_1 : Post-expressionism is a term coined by the German art critic Franz Roh to describe a variety of movements in the post-war art world which were influenced by expressionism but defined themselves through rejecting its aesthetic. Roh first used the term in an essay in 1925, \"Magic Realism: Post-Expressionism\", to contrast to Gustav Friedrich Hartlaub's \"New Objectivity\", which more narrowly characterized these developments within German art. Though Roh saw \"post-expressionism\" and \"magic realism\" as synonymous, later critics characterized distinctions between magic realism and other artists initially identified by Hartlaub and have also pointed out other artists in Europe who had different stylistic tendencies but were working within the same trend. Context_2 : Andrew Newell Wyeth ( ; July 12, 1917 \u2013 January 16, 2009) was a visual artist, primarily a realist painter, working predominantly in a regionalist style. He was one of the best-known U.S. artists of the middle 20th century. Context_3 : Marvin Cone (October 21, 1891\u2013 May 18, 1965) was an American painter in the regionalist style. Context_4 : Russ Warren (born 1951) is a contemporary figurative painter who has exhibited extensively throughout the U.S. and abroad, notably in the 1981 Whitney Biennial and the 1984 Venice Biennale. A painter in the Neo-Expressionist style, he has drawn inspiration from Spanish masters such as Vel\u00e1zquez, Goya and Picasso, as well as from Mexican folk art and the American southwest. Committed to his own Regionalist style during his formative years in Texas and New Mexico, he was picked up by Phyllis Kind in 1981. During those years he transitioned to a style characterized by \"magical realism\", and his work came to rely on symbol allegory, and unusual shifts in scale. Throughout his career, his paintings and prints have featured flat figures, jagged shadows, and semi-autobiographical content. His oil paintings layer paint, often incorporate collage, and usually contain either figures or horses juxtaposed in strange tableaux. Context_5 : Magical realism, magic realism, or marvelous realism is a genre of narrative fiction and, more broadly, art (literature, painting, film, theatre, etc.) that, while encompassing a range of subtly different concepts, expresses a primarily realistic view of the real world while also adding or revealing magical elements. It is sometimes called fabulism, in reference to the conventions of fables, myths, and allegory. \"Magical realism\", perhaps the most common term, often refers to fiction and literature in particular, with magic or the supernatural presented in an otherwise real-world or mundane setting. Context_6 : James H. Cromartie is an internationally renowned American artist credited with the birth of Hard-Edge Realism, a style by turns both redolent of and a departure from the Magic Realism pioneered by Andrew Wyeth. The list of celebrities and wealthy patrons reported to be among his collectors is extensive and examples of Cromartie\u2019s work may be found in 125 countries across the globe. Domestically, Cromartie has been called, \u201cone of America\u2019s leading historical artists,\u201d for his commissioned portraits of the White House, Smithsonian Institution, U.S Capitol and Supreme Court, among others. In 2005, James H. Cromartie\u2019s historical portrait of the White House was featured in the widely distributed art history textbook, ArtTalk, a distinction granted to a mere 25 living artists globally. Cromartie has resided year-round on Nantucket, Massachusetts for over 35 years, proudly quipping, \u201cthere are Nantucket artists, but then again there are\u2026artists who have chosen to live on Nantucket. There\u2019s a b-i-g difference.\u201d Context_7 : George Clair Tooker, Jr. (August 5, 1920 \u2013 March 27, 2011) was an American figurative painter. His works are associated with Magic realism, Social realism, Photorealism and Surrealism. His subjects are depicted naturally as in a photograph, but the images use flat tones, an ambiguous perspective, and alarming juxtapositions to suggest an imagined or dreamed reality. He did not agree with the association of his work with Magic realism or Surrealism, as he said, \"I am after painting reality impressed on the mind so hard that it returns as a dream, but I am not after painting dreams as such, or fantasy.\" In 1968, he was elected to the National Academy of Design and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Tooker was one of nine recipients of the National Medal of Arts in 2007. Context_8 : William Moise (1922\u20131980) was a visual artist, primarily an abstract impressionist painter, working in a regionalist style. Context_9 : The Sydney School, also the Nuts and Berries style, refers to an architectural style by a group of architects in Australia who reacted against international Modernism with their own regionalist style during the 1960s. In contrast to the purism of the international style, they were drawn to rustic materials, clinker bricks, low gutter lines, and raked roof lines rather than flat roof lines. Context_10 : Carroll Nathaniel Jones III (July 2, 1944 - June 22, 2017) was an artist in the style of American realism. Carroll grew up in New Providence, New Jersey where his father, an illustrator for Life (magazine), was his first art teacher. He taught Carroll techniques of the Old Masters, who emphasized light, perspective, and composition. Carroll went to school in New York City (NYC) and enrolled in the Phoenix School of Design at age 17. He later attended Hartford Art School and became a commissioned portraitist for 10 years. His work, \"Church Window\" was recognized in the New York Times, and he moved away from portraits to recreate scenes that sparked memories of his childhood. He was most influenced by Andrew Wyeth and Edward Hopper. The Coe-Kerr Gallery of NYC and Whistler's Daughter Gallery of New Jersey represented him, as well as contemporaries Wyeth and Hopper. Malcolm Forbes, Frederick R. Koch, Stephen Sondheim, William Schuman, and Jean Shepherd held private collections of his work. He exhibited at Newark Museum and Trenton Art Museum in New Jersey, and in universities, galleries and museums in seven states by his mid-thirties. His work is part of the permanent collections of Seton Hall University and Newark Museum. Art critic Marion Filler considered his work Magic realism, a quiet movement made popular in America beginning in the 1920s by Hopper, and related to Surrealism. fact_1 : James H. Cromartie is an internationally renowned American artist credited with the birth of Hard-Edge Realism, a style by turns both redolent of and a departure from the Magic Realism pioneered by Andrew Wyeth. fact_2 : Andrew Newell Wyeth ( ; July 12, 1917 \u2013 January 16, 2009) was a visual artist, primarily a realist painter, working predominantly in a regionalist style.
